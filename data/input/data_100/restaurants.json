Even though they have expanded to another location in Scarborough, so that there are now two Silver Spoons, the Pickering location has managed to maintain consistent quality, although it can vary on days.\nWell, what restaurant doesn't have that problem? You might be suddenly short-staffed (someone down with the flu), or perhaps one of your deliveries didn't make it on time? \nIt is good food. I prefer the Pakistani cuisine: Nihari, Haleem (not always available) and several of the biryanis. They are now offering Sindhi Biryani on weekends, and I'm so pleased! The only way that I could get that in the past was to make it myself using a packaged spice blend. \nIf you want to get Naan, I recommend the Butter Naan. Although it costs a bit more, the butter enhancements really take the Naan to the next level of browning and savoury tastes. Ok, things sit under the heat lamp, but they do not seem to suffer that much (particularly something like Nihari, which is a stew-type dish that can withstand the warming table. Everything has always tasted fresh when I have ordered it.\nI find that the samosas are fairly standard, but there are other appetizers which are more exciting. For people who like the dark meat of the chicken, Lollypop Chicken is great and consistently good. I also enjoy Shami Kabab. If you like fish, don't skip the Fingerfish, which is consistently tasty.\nWhenever I have been there, which is perhaps once a month or two, for the past five years, the portions have been generous.\nI am certainly a fan, and the Silver Spoon fills an important niche in the local, Pickering community as a convenient place to pick up some Halal take-away of decent quality.", "name": "Katya"}, {"review_id": "r-NLaGpX4hCMraZ9OukN0AnQ", "user_id": "u-Uaqawx2iD0mT5YP_akJrJw", "date": "2014-06-27 00:28:47", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Oh, Silver Spoon. I've tried to love you. I've given you so many chances. \n\nBut this just isn't working out anymore.\n\nTo start: the food isn't exactly terrible. It's just...not very good. I've tried almost every meat dish, the chana masala, samosas, biriyanis, etc. Indian take-out is hardly known for its healthiness, but when you order a veal karahi and get two sad chunks of meat floating in half a container in oil, it's a little disheartening. Add to that the fact that food is often sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long...\n\nOn the upside: the chicken biriyani is good bang for your buck - especially during the week when it's on special. You get a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat. It's ready to go, so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for your order. There was that one time they ran out of chicken biriyani (which is understandable when it's on special) but then offered me a \"regular biriyani\" (read: JUST rice) for the same price. Ummm, say what?\n\nI do love their beef samosas - it's just to bad that they NEVER HAVE ANY. Seriously, I have been here early in the evening, at random times during the week, and they have loads of sad looking veggie samosas, but no beef. I feel like the owners need to do a serious evaluation of what works and doesn't work. If you notice you're always selling out of a certain item (and NOT another), doesn't it make sense to up that portion while downsizing another? Who knows.\n\nMy biggest gripe was the chana masala incident.\nThe last time I went in, I ordered a chana masala (which I'm apathetic about, but my husband likes). The girl at the counter kind of made a face and said, \"Oh...no. You don't want that.\" I was confused. There was a whole tray of it there, brimming with chick-pea goodness. \"It's not...good today.\" \n\nWhat? What does that mean? Is the taste just 'off' or had it spoiled? In either event, why is there a full tray of \"not good\" chana masala here for customers to look at (and possible walk out the door with)? I stared at the tray, and she motioned at it again, \"I was just going to remove it from here anyway.\"\n\nBut, um, you didn't. And I was the only person in the store. From the wide glass window, before I even stepped in, I could see that there was no one else even there. She hadn't even come over until I'd been standing there for a few minutes. \n\nIt really bothers me that I still really don't know what was so wrong with an entire tray of food that it would warrant being thrown out - and why it HADN'T been thrown out immediately if it really couldn't be saved. It was clear from the crispiness on the top (you know, that kind of layer of 'skin' that develops?) that it had been sitting for a while. Ultimately, I'm really quite relieved the staff person told me before I bought it, took it home and got diarrhea or something (this would be a much harsher review if that had happened...) And I guess that says something positive about the customer service (sorta...)\n\nAs more and more Indian food places - both takeout and dine-in - emerge in the region, store owners need to realize that customers are going to eventually become more discerning. I really wanted this place to be a favorite - after all, it's very convenient for me - but, sorry, Silver Spoon, you just don't make the cut.", "name": "Heli"}, {"review_id": "r-ZAmkMWTSbWQRO-uEzYmR8g", "user_id": "u-pj7M1RIWV0caCp7Kj91JxA", "date": "2014-12-17 03:39:34", "rating": 3.0, "text": "They do not have lots of crowd and it taste is different than other locations.

We are all big fans of Indian food who eat at Indian restaurants, locally and internationally, on a regular basis.  The service at Spice South was pretty poor.

When we asked for chutney or something like it, we were told \"we don't have chutney\". I ordered a lamb dish which, although it was edible and spiced perfectly, was very chewy. I felt quite lucky as another person at our table didn't receive their food at all. We had to track down our apologetic waiter to ask about her order.  Her food eventually showed up, but not until after the rest of us had pretty much finished our meals.

I have to say I've definitely had better Indian food for some reason the taste does seen rather bland for authentic Indian cuisine  I think the chiefs play it safe with the level of spice. Most dishes are delicious it just seems like something is missing for it to be considered real great Indian cuisine. I do not know enough about how to cook Indian food to say exactly what it is. I like the fact that the dishes are not salty, the only time I feel bad from the food is when I eat to much. The tandoori although good seems a little short on flavor, small pieces the butter chicken is quite disappointing it is very rich and doesn't taste \nlike butter chicken I remember from other restaurants, not to mention it has bones in it what a sin. There always seems to be more sauce than chicken.The pieces I thought were quite small. The beef dish is good, the curry goat and chicken not so much the meat on these dishes seems very tough, I think they use the cheapest meat for the buffet. I haven't  tried the dishes on the menu yet bet I assume they are allot better. The veggie dishes seem old like they've been sitting their for days, overall the buffet does not seem to heat the food I have never seen the dishes really hot there not cold just lukewarm. The only hot item is when they bring the Nan bread from the oven. I really wish they had more of those famous  Indian\ndeserts, instead of ice cream which I don't think is sanitary to leave it there and everybody dig in to it and they need to cover it separately as well not just the door. The service unfortunately is not that great either the owner is very friendly, however the waiters seem disengaged like they just want to go home, no small talk no smile nothing. The worst thing for me about being served in a restaurant is when I have to ask for EVERYTHING, I don't mind sometimes but I always have to ask for another drink, more water, napkins remove bottles etc. every single time. The place does give the appearance of being clean especially the washrooms which is one of the reasons I go back. I must say I have seen attitude from some of the staff again not the owner who is always professional. On one occasion a girl working there who I never seen  before or ever since actually spoke rather rudely to me in an unfriendly tone for putting a little sauce back on the buffet dish from my plate OMG Call the police lol. Last thing I want to address is the decor definitely needs an upgrade seating could be set up better to maximize space, the carpet looks old and decrepit and the T.V looks nice but I've never seen it on. I don't think they want to pay for cable and no clock, whats up with that, oh I get it don't let people know what time it is so they won't leave to soon or have another beverage. The thing I hate about the buffet section is there is no light I think it should be the other way around lots of light to see the buffet and less light in the dinning room perhaps candles would make for a better dinning experience, flowers would create ambience, sometimes the music is too loud for dinning.  I think rather than everybody so close to each other in the dinning room they should use the other room as well especially on the weekends where seating is an issue. One more thing, through the week business is petty slow sometimes only me and a few people are there.So why play games with the few customers you have, one time a waiter who is no longer there charged me imported price for domestic beer I brought it to the owner's attention and he adjusted the bill the next time I went, no apologies were given everybody know's Budweiser is domestic duh. Another time I specifically asked for a Canada Dry Ginger Ale and that's the name it is listed as on the menu, the owner brings it to me and life is good. The next one I ordered he brings no name ginger ale I was so angry I just left as soon as I finished the meal I didn't want to lose it. Ant the no name of course tastes like crap that's why its cheap but he still charged me the $2.50. One time the said waiter who is no longer there when I asked him to remove the bottles from the table, he said you have a big table with lots of room. What the hell is he talking to me like that for. Unbelievable this is not how you talk to customers who pay your bills. As you can imagine it was reflected in the tip. Another time they tried to give me a bottle of beer that was opened for days flat as hell, they corrected that when I  spoke up about it.\nLook I'm not saying to avoid this place at all, I just know they could make it a whole lot better.\nI usually go alone and I've noticed the more people the better the service.(the  bigger the tip) By all means check it out the buffet used to be $10.95 they just raised it to $14.95 but the buffet items did not change at all, nothing new added go figure.", "name": "Pierre"}, {"review_id": "r-bA9_SyRS3Z3h5IgMpEgt-A", "user_id": "u-rlqSOqnC4IDP612W2DlYLw", "date": "2013-11-26 19:34:31", "rating": 1.0, "text": "Went there for a Sunday lunch party.

In my opinion, the food was actually quite tasty. But I feel like the spice of the food was toned down quite a bit to make it a little bit more palatable for non-Indian diners. I like my food VERY SPICY, and I wish I asked for like chilies or something. \n\n- The Butter chicken was good. Even though a buffet, the chicken was not dry. \n- I was afraid that the Tandoori Chicken would be dry but it actually wasn't. It was mostly dark meat but the chicken was not dry at all. \n- They had some Indian style pasta which I thought was quite funny (I whispered to my brother... \"this is for white people\" LOL).\n- The rest of the food? I don't even remember what they were called. I think I had Aloo Gobi or something (Potato/cauliflower curry) but they were all quite tasty.\n\nWhat got me really excited..... UNLIMITED NAAN BREAD, and you don't even have to ask for it. It keeps refilling itself.\n\n\n~SERVICE\nThe servers were quite attentive. We did not have to wait for them to refill our drinks/water. I did not have to ask them to give us more naan bread, they just kept coming. The only time we had to ask them for something was when we needed our bill.\n\n\n~OVERALL EXPERIENCE\nIt was good.

The cart with the food  wasn't even full. Once we ate food  we had to use the same plate to get food again if we wanted seconds.

It was only 5:15pm on a Monday and super busy ... excellent selection of food items (overwhelming when you are not too sure what you are in the mood for).  We got the Chili Chicken, Chicken Curry and Chicken Biryani combo - generous portions, excellent spice rating (real deal spice) - busy place, staff super helpful and friendly and go out of their way to describe the individual dishes.  2 Huge servings for $18.08 of combo for 2 people.\n\nBig thanks to the guy from Oshawa in the line-up next to us who was super helpful in what to order (now I understand why he drove all the way from Oshawa for this grub....its very good). Another plus for Ajax having this place ( I am only the second person to review considering this place is the busiest place in the new mall I expect more reviews with good writeup's forthcoming from others)....  absolutely a must try (Ajax just keeps getting better and better \"food-wise\").  The food is in those buffet style hotplate's that keep food \"warm\"; so isn't scalding hot by any means - but still tasty none the less.  Most customers were take-out  (there is a seating area with a few people sitting down having food).  There are frozen paratha's and frozen food items in the freezer section (that they have made).\n\nBig plus having so many ethnic places in Ajax that have good food, decent portions, good prices and excellent quality of ingredients.

We also ordered one of the curry dishes and a Ravaa Dosa, which was served with chutney and lentil soup.  The dosa was served flat on the plate, as opposed to the rolled up dosas that I have had in the past.  Finally, we shared some cheese bread.  I can't say enough greats things about the quality of the food and the flavors.   There were two things that we thought could have been better.  The dishes could have been served a little warmer than what they were.  The second thing is that the service was painfully slow.  It took at least 30 minutes for our first dish to be served.  And it stayed slow, all the way til the end of our meal. Perhaps they are undergoing start up pains or perhaps they were understaffed tonight.  No sure.  What I will remember is the how my palette jumped up and down with each bite.   There is a bar in the restaurant, but the emphasis seems to be on beer and wine.

To be 100% honest with you, I didn't know what a Dosa is - it's essentially a folded crepe. \nRed Chillez offers a traditional buffet with some non-standard items. I really enjoyed trying all of the dips and spreads and figuring out what I loved and what I still haven't acquired a taste for. In addition to the buffet, there are Dosa menus on the tables for you to basically order bottomless, made-to-order Dosas.

The dosa menu has six vegetarian options, three non-veg, and three kid-friendly options. We had a group of about 12 people, so we ordered several to share. My hands-down favorite was the butter chicken dosa. The buffet had your basic Indian staples, plus a hot chai tea. A bottle of water, the buffet, and made to order dosas = about $14. Great price. \n\nOther notes: you can place orders online. You can also choose your level of spiciness for each dish. They also offer breakfast Friday-Sunday from 8-11am. For the lunch crowd, they have a promo where you can get a free lunch buffet when you purchase nine buffets.\n\nHighly recommend checking this place out on a Tuesday.

Granted, all the ones I've been to have been on the East Coast, so this might be great for Madison/Wisconsin. I got my usual mango lassi to accompany my meal, and it came with whipped cream and maraschino cherries and what seemed to be grenadine. Why would you do that? Not only does the mango not taste like real mango, the lassi came out way sweeter than any I've had and probably sweeter than any proper lassi you'd find in India. In a similar vein, the food was OK, but it was missing the potency so signature of Indian spice, that fragrance that's supposed to envelop you when at Indian restaurants. Where is the meaty grilledness in the tandoori chicken? Where is that earthy cumin in your samosa? Everything just tasted kind of...impotent. I can't tell if it's because they're trying to pander to Midwestern tastes or if they're skimping on the spices for business reasons, but I left the place without the taste of pungency that I was really hoping to load up on when I go to Indian buffets.\n\nPS - After reading a few reviews from some Indian customers that also mentioned that they could improve their flavor, I feel like less of a crazy person.

But the service today was REALLY BAD! A coworker of mine ordered a chicken wrap, i know for a fact that she ordered chicken since she was young she never ate BEEF because of her religion so there is no way in hell that she will ever order BEEF. So she got her wrap and she started eating it. Since its a wrap unless you disassemble it you would not know by the looks of it whether it was red or white meat inside so she took a bite and ate it. Never in her life she tasted beef so she ask us taste it since it tasted weird for her. So we disassembled the wrap at this point and tasted the meat inside it. It was beef!!!!! At that point my coworker talked to the cashier and informed her that instead of giving her chicken, she gave her beef. Instead of apologizing, she raised her voice to my coworker and told her she made a mistake on her order which was not true at all. Unfortunately  we don't have a proof since the receipt just says lunch special. She did not apologized , she did not even offer to give her a replacement. At this point my coworker even though clearly upset but hungry  ordered another chicken wrap despite us telling her not to do it and we can just transfer to another restaurant. I was well tempted to just really make a scene but We don't want to stoop down to her level. The 5 of us and all other people that we know of swear never again to go back to this restaurant!  I understand that the reason that the cashier would have not  admitted her mistake was that it might end up that she foot the bill. But what I don't understand is why she needs to raise her voice to my coworker.   A simple hint of humility could have been ok. If there is 0 stars, i will definitely give this place that.

I told her that he should eat then.  When the new meal came the chicken pieces were tiny as if they had took a regular piece and cut it in half to make it look like there was more chicken.

I've lived all over the country, and have had Indian enough to know ... \"good from great\". Soma Grill is truly \"great\" food. I've been to this place with my husband over a dozen times and we'll keep coming back. \n\nWhy, you ask? \n\nWell, the answer is simple. The food is hand made every day, the staff is full of heart and spirt, and the owner is a wonderful woman who truly cares about her guests.\n\nHere's some things I'd like to brag about eating there:\n\nStart with the:\nVegetable Samosa's (comes with an order of two and two dipping sauces) - these triangular delights are a perfect way to start your meal. The green dipping sauce is perfectly spicy and compliments the brown sweet dipping sauce. YUM!!!\n \nFor dinner we share. Here's what we love there ... but first, you must know dinner comes with a cup of mildly spicy and delicious lentil soup, as well as a fresh salad. The salad has a zesty yogurt dressing lightly garnishing the top of it. Now for the main course.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala (this comes in a light red/orange cream sauce) The chicken is tender and the sauce has a bold rich tomato flavor. Mmmmm ... Get the Naan to dip in this sauce so no drop goes to waste. \n\nLamb Kashmiri (this has a mild burgandy sauce with almonds in it) The lamb tastes like it has been cooking all day. If you've ever had \"osso bucco\" from an Italian restaurant ... you know that succulent meat that falls off the bone. This lamb is as tender as that. AND the sauce, it has a ton of flavor. If you eat lamb this is something you must try. \n\nFish (Cod) Madras (this is perfectly cooked white fish in a very fresh rich colored tomato sauce with onions and mushrooms) What I really like about this dish is how much it complements the heavier flavors in the tikka massala's cream sauce. \n\nIf you're looking for a vegetable dish my husband and I have tried a few of them. Our favorite is the \"Aloo Gobi\" \n\nAloo Gobi (this dish has potato's and cauliflower mixed in a light, fresh crushed tomato sauce) It's very good and a nice compliment to all the meat dishes we order  to share. \n\nWe've had both the garlic and regular naan. They're perfect for dipping, and in my opinion, naan is a \"must have\" when eating an Indian meal. \n\nRice comes with the meals, so if you don't want bread but want a starch, you'll be happy to know white rice accompanies all entrees. \n\nAs for dessert we've had the rice pudding and pistachio ice-cream (this is the kulfi) on the menu. Between those two, I'd pick the pistachio ice-cream every time. It's very refreshing after a hot meal. \n\nAlso, each time we visit I always get the hot chai tea. This milky goodness is made to order and is worth the wait. You add the sugar which puts you in the drivers seat, as far as sweetness goes.\n\nI recommend Soma Grill to anyone looking to try something other than a chain restaurant. This food is worth a try and if you already like Indian food take my dinner suggestions. You won't be sorry! \n\nHope this helps -- Enjoy!", "name": "Malinda"}, {"review_id": "r-s6yZiTquKMnEwBUOgnXkWA", "user_id": "u-tLb-WQFc2fHo5MgF4DwSVw", "date": "2012-01-08 18:32:17", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Nice little hole-in-the-wally sort of place, with the feeling of a family owned neighborhood joint mainly patronized by locals.

This dish could be served in a fine restaurant.\n\nAnother surprise: I usually don't go crazy for Asian deserts but we shared a pudding of carrots, raisins, cashews, rice sugar and cream ( Halwah? ) that manage to taste very unusual, yet familiar and delish as well. \n\nAn Indian couple seem to own and run this place, the wife is the cook and she really aims to please. She came out to our table 3 times to talk to us although there were a fair amount of customers - mostly Indians. We had dinner there twice and I think this lady does her best with the vegetarian dishes. I tend to be a meat eater myself but I'll stick to their vegetarian menu in the future\n\nThey also have a decent wine selection for $5 a glass which doesn't hurt the dining experience.", "name": "George"}, {"review_id": "r-2NPL-7A4oBN8uWkRg0JSuA", "user_id": "u-HVq7SYfZ4hpFFVsAU_Ub_Q", "date": "2013-07-25 19:09:22", "rating": 4.0, "text": "I finally was able to make it here for lunch, and I'm so glad I did!

My favourite is definitely the Tandoori Kabob. The chicken was juicy and flavourful, with a bit of a kick. The chicken breast is good if you aren't looking for something spicy. As for the Chaplee Kabob, it was my first time trying this dish. I liked the marinade and the meat was cooked perfectly, but it was quite oily...\n\nThe salad is always fresh and I love the Afghani bread (especially dipped in both the sauces). For about $2 more, you can get a dinner platter which comes with quite a bit of basmati rice. \n\nWatan Kabob has a fairly straightforward ordering system. You just have to order and pay at the counter, then wait until your number is called. \n\nIt can be quite busy, even on a weeknight, packed with families and children playing hide-and-seek behind you. \n\nWatan Kabob is very similar to Bamiyan Kabob (I read in an earlier review that the owner of Watan Kabob used to work there). However, it differs from a restaurant with waiter service, an extensive menu, and more comfortable seating, like Paramount. Unfortunately, Watan Kabob does not make the thick garlic sauce that Paramount offers, but I enjoyed the food at Watan Kabob more and the menu is more reasonably priced. The only reason I would return to Paramount is for their appetizers, manakeesh, and baklawa.", "name": "Eva"}, {"review_id": "r-INPxAjbcigWkT12ZcN8p3A", "user_id": "u-LWu1oEhz4jhiV1o5K4amKA", "date": "2016-08-06 03:08:52", "rating": 1.0, "text": "I would give them 0/5.

I was pretty pleased they had many more veg items compared to 4 non-veg dishes. I the never seen a veg biriyani being part of buffet. It was always chicken biriyani. So my non-veg friends were not too pleased with this. They had a paneer pulao so I would suggest to replace that with a non-veg rice item. For me the highlight was Aloo Bonda and the fried baby corn.

Our waitress, Sri, asked if we like spicy. I told her yes, but that she shouldn't take that as a challenge. Sri gave me a sly grin that said \"challenge accepted!\"\n\nShe brought us an appetizer of Corn Vepudu, roasted kernels with just a bit of a bite on the back end. I could eat that stuff like popcorn, very tasty. \n\nFor entrees, we got Kadai Chicken, tender chunks in a medium-spice tomato based sauce (not the sort of thing I'd usually order, but there's a great variety there, and it was delish); and the old standby Saag Paneer, which is often sort of bland, but this was quite spicy, and it made me wonder why everyone doesn't serve it so fiery? Fantastic. \n\nAdded some garlic naan, which was a little thinner than I'm used to, but that was an interesting change. For drinks, they had some summer specials that were very unusual to our palates -- mine was a faintly salty lemonade, my wife had a mint cooler. These have required me to reassess my opinion of traditional American soft drinks, and I now think we could stand some more exotic ingredients. \n\nOverall, I'll say not your average Indian restaurant, with a wide variety of options I'll need to explore my next time through Arizona. \n\nWord to the wise -- pay in cash and get 10% off!

They bring out different chutneys to dip in the pieces your rip off. Not only was this fun, but it was absolutely delicious! They have many different varieties so step out of your comfort zone and give it a try. We were also impressed with the wide selection of goat dishes. The meat fell right off the bones and the sauces were super rich and flavorful. \n\nAfter polishing off the best mango lassi we've had out here, we were commenting how we couldn't eat another bite...but then Vischu tempted us with a dessert we've never tried.

Don't let their buffet style confuse you, it was also new to me. They bring out the items on the menu as you order them. So it's kind of like \"Tapas\" style dinning rather than a buffet bar where you scoop up your own servings. I actually kind of like this style as I didn't over eat and yet I was fully satisfied.

We were able to pass dishes around with ease so it was like our own family style buffet. \n\nKaren walked us through some options and we started with our fan favorite: Chicken Tikka Masala.  The sauce was flavorful and delicious, we ended up getting 3 helpings of it.  We also tried the Goat Roganjosh which reminded me of a pot roast, very tender meat.  My unexpected favorite was the Chicken Saag - I have never had it before but now I will make sure to order it every time.  We also tried the naan, Makhani Daal and a roasted eggplant puree with spices but I cant remember the name of it.   All the food was well balanced with spices and flavor and the owner and staff were all really friendly.\n\nI love supporting local businesses and if you are in the mood for great Indian food, I would definitely suggest it!

No matter what size glass you give to the guest, a refill is still a refill.\n\nAlso, another con to this place is you basically get \"nickle and dime\"-d. Side sauces like the tamarind sauce, cilantro sauce and raita where you normally get for free at 90% of other Indian restaurants, here you get charged for it. Being in the business, I get where their mentality stems from, but to actually experience it as a paying guest, I abstain from enjoying these condiments here. \n\nFood is nothing to brag about, but for price and convenience of this place being closer than MOST Indian restaurants that I would normally visit, I would still come back.\n\nHey, cheap eats is cheap eats.

However, I immediately had a sinking feeling when we entered the restaurant and noticed that the place was empty. Completely silent! In fact, there was not even a worker or owner present until my uncle whistled, prompting the owner to rush towards us and seated us. After he seated us, I waited a few minutes, and when water didn't show, I felt annoyed that I had to ask for water. It's a restaurant, Jesus Christ ! In addition, I noticed the lack of papadum and the various chutneys I was familiar with receiving at every Indian restaurant I had ever been too. However, I forgave this as maybe things are not the same in Vegas as Los Angeles. On the topic of service, every single item we ordered took absurdly long to prepare, considering we were the ONLY customers present. In fact, one of my uncles had specially ordered a Chana masala without onion and garlic because he doesn't eat that. The item didn't even show up until the rest of us had almost finished eating. \n\nService aside, let's move on to the most important part: quality of food. The vegetable Pakora, the first appetizer, was literally a cauliflower fried in unseasoned batter which was disgusting. Hell, anyone could make better pakoras than what was prepared by Armaan Taste of India. On some pieces, I could see the raw cauliflower which had none of the flavorless batter. Unappetizing much? I decided to clear my mind; perhaps the main dishes would be somewhat decent. Oh boy, was I wrong! The paneer tikka masala tasted like someone had dumped heaps of tomato paste, tomato pur\u00e9e, and chunks of tomato, with sugar and small sprinkles of Indian spices. This was despite my request for extremely spicy paneer tikka masala. The malai kofta gravy tasted like raw sewage diluted with turmeric and chilly power. By far, the most disgusting dish. The channa masala which my uncle had ordered looked like little shit pieces in brown gravy. The next morning, my uncle said he threw up all of the disgusting channa masala. \n\nI presume the high ratings are from non-Indians who don't know how delicious Indian food can be when prepared properly. To you, I suggest visiting restaurants recommended by any Indians you may know.

They do have the usual Aloo Gobi (cauliflower dish), Palak Paneer, and the pakoras.  The quality was ok, but nothing special.  As for the meat dishes, the butter chicken rather bland - shocking for butter chicken, I know.  Disappointing :(.

The tandoori chicken was kind of dry but garnishes is very important. \n\nThe bro bowl (12$)- that is like a Indian salad bowl concept comes with your choice of protein and side. The butter paneer was really good- but I regret not taking the rice as a base- since I was so rushed to order.\n\nThe bhel puri (not on online menu)- or indian trail mix that comes with puffy baked rice grains, peanuts, fried spicy dough bits, and salad toppings mixed in with a sweet and spicy tamarind sauce was a solid dish. Don't keep this for leftovers because it won't taste as good.\n\nThe butter chicken poutine (10$)- my favorite dish-I was disappointed there weren't real french fries but more so potato wedges. The portion was huge! but french fries would really make a difference.\n\n The mango lassi was so nice to have alongside all this food. All this food fed 3 people and cost less than 50$ total.

I was extremely satisfied with my channa samosa - It was served impeccably with just the right amount of chickpea curry and crunch and topped with pomegranates - perfection! \nAll the 'bowl' foods are made in front of you, like a sandwich/salad bar but the naans are made fresh at the back so we received ours a little later. We didn't mind as it came out hot and fresh, sparkling with 'ghee' (clarified butter) - yum! Highly recommend the garlic naan!\n\nPrices are reasonable and portion sizes are decent.

They were great with refills and prompt delivery of our food (and also patience with the fact that we food blogger types have to take pictures of everything before we eat it).\n\nThey do have a wine list, and while it's small, it's also relatively cheap.  The bottles were all less than $30 each, and we got a nice shiraz to go with our dinner.\n\nWe started with the samosas, which were quite good, but standard, and then, in a flash of greatness, the words 'vegetable chat' caught my eye on the menu.\n\nVegetable chat is this thing that I love, that I've never known the name of.  It's a cold almost-salsa-like dish made up of chickpeas, potatoes, onions, and Indian seasonings, then topped with crunchy crackers (the same consistency and flavor of the samosa shell), yogurt, and tamarind sauce.  It's like a less-mayonnaise-d version of potato salad.  Oh, how I love it!  Star of India's was absolutely perfect, and I'm so glad I took a chance on ordering it.\n\nHowever, not wanting to step totally out of my comfort zone, I ordered my typical mattar paneer.  It was good, and not a huge portion, so I didn't feel compelled to just keep eating and eating the deliciousness in front of me.\n\nMy husband got the tandoor mixed grill, which had chicken, shrimp, and lamb.  He was crazy about it.  Like most Indian restaurants, you can pick the level of spice for each entree.  The garlic naan was ridiculously puffy and buttery, which we loved.\n\nWe will definitely return to Star of India.  It's much more low-key than India Garden, but the food is just as good.  If you want a nice, laid-back place to have a bottle of wine and some tasty Indian food, check this restaurant out.

Even though they have expanded to another location in Scarborough, so that there are now two Silver Spoons, the Pickering location has managed to maintain consistent quality, although it can vary on days.\nWell, what restaurant doesn't have that problem? You might be suddenly short-staffed (someone down with the flu), or perhaps one of your deliveries didn't make it on time? \nIt is good food. I prefer the Pakistani cuisine: Nihari, Haleem (not always available) and several of the biryanis. They are now offering Sindhi Biryani on weekends, and I'm so pleased! The only way that I could get that in the past was to make it myself using a packaged spice blend. \nIf you want to get Naan, I recommend the Butter Naan. Although it costs a bit more, the butter enhancements really take the Naan to the next level of browning and savoury tastes. Ok, things sit under the heat lamp, but they do not seem to suffer that much (particularly something like Nihari, which is a stew-type dish that can withstand the warming table. Everything has always tasted fresh when I have ordered it.\nI find that the samosas are fairly standard, but there are other appetizers which are more exciting. For people who like the dark meat of the chicken, Lollypop Chicken is great and consistently good. I also enjoy Shami Kabab. If you like fish, don't skip the Fingerfish, which is consistently tasty.\nWhenever I have been there, which is perhaps once a month or two, for the past five years, the portions have been generous.\nI am certainly a fan, and the Silver Spoon fills an important niche in the local, Pickering community as a convenient place to pick up some Halal take-away of decent quality.", "name": "Katya"}, {"review_id": "r-NLaGpX4hCMraZ9OukN0AnQ", "user_id": "u-Uaqawx2iD0mT5YP_akJrJw", "date": "2014-06-27 00:28:47", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Oh, Silver Spoon. I've tried to love you. I've given you so many chances. \n\nBut this just isn't working out anymore.\n\nTo start: the food isn't exactly terrible. It's just...not very good. I've tried almost every meat dish, the chana masala, samosas, biriyanis, etc. Indian take-out is hardly known for its healthiness, but when you order a veal karahi and get two sad chunks of meat floating in half a container in oil, it's a little disheartening. Add to that the fact that food is often sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long...\n\nOn the upside: the chicken biriyani is good bang for your buck - especially during the week when it's on special. You get a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat. It's ready to go, so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for your order. There was that one time they ran out of chicken biriyani (which is understandable when it's on special) but then offered me a \"regular biriyani\" (read: JUST rice) for the same price. Ummm, say what?\n\nI do love their beef samosas - it's just to bad that they NEVER HAVE ANY. Seriously, I have been here early in the evening, at random times during the week, and they have loads of sad looking veggie samosas, but no beef. I feel like the owners need to do a serious evaluation of what works and doesn't work. If you notice you're always selling out of a certain item (and NOT another), doesn't it make sense to up that portion while downsizing another? Who knows.\n\nMy biggest gripe was the chana masala incident.\nThe last time I went in, I ordered a chana masala (which I'm apathetic about, but my husband likes). The girl at the counter kind of made a face and said, \"Oh...no. You don't want that.\" I was confused. There was a whole tray of it there, brimming with chick-pea goodness. \"It's not...good today.\" \n\nWhat? What does that mean? Is the taste just 'off' or had it spoiled? In either event, why is there a full tray of \"not good\" chana masala here for customers to look at (and possible walk out the door with)? I stared at the tray, and she motioned at it again, \"I was just going to remove it from here anyway.\"\n\nBut, um, you didn't. And I was the only person in the store. From the wide glass window, before I even stepped in, I could see that there was no one else even there. She hadn't even come over until I'd been standing there for a few minutes. \n\nIt really bothers me that I still really don't know what was so wrong with an entire tray of food that it would warrant being thrown out - and why it HADN'T been thrown out immediately if it really couldn't be saved. It was clear from the crispiness on the top (you know, that kind of layer of 'skin' that develops?) that it had been sitting for a while. Ultimately, I'm really quite relieved the staff person told me before I bought it, took it home and got diarrhea or something (this would be a much harsher review if that had happened...) And I guess that says something positive about the customer service (sorta...)\n\nAs more and more Indian food places - both takeout and dine-in - emerge in the region, store owners need to realize that customers are going to eventually become more discerning. I really wanted this place to be a favorite - after all, it's very convenient for me - but, sorry, Silver Spoon, you just don't make the cut.", "name": "Heli"}, {"review_id": "r-ZAmkMWTSbWQRO-uEzYmR8g", "user_id": "u-pj7M1RIWV0caCp7Kj91JxA", "date": "2014-12-17 03:39:34", "rating": 3.0, "text": "They do not have lots of crowd and it taste is different than other locations.

Each item cost less than 10$. This meal complimented nicely with a white wine : Pinot Gris\n\nCons: this place has a more of a fast food vibe compared to the other location.

Thought this would turn out to be another good find for Hakka food, as the dishes did look quite good in the pics. \n\nWe ordered fish pakora, chicken Manchurian, Bombay chicken, and Manchurian chicken noodles. Our order took a really really long time to be served. All guests that got seated after us got their orders before us. Then the food arrived ....in reverse order....lol. \nFirst came the noodles, then came the two chicken dishes, and finally came the appetizer. We were told that the fish pakora takes a long time to be prepared. While one of the owners was upfront and apologized for the delay (appreciate it), the other owner said we had ordered after all the other guests....which was just made up. \n\nBut the delay wasn't really a big deal. Sometime some dishes may take longer for any number of reasons, it's very understandable. Our experience of the dinner here wasn't really affected by the wait for the food....but by the food itself. \n\nFood arrived, backwards, but looked good. \nBoth the deep fried dishes: fish pakora and Bombay chicken had a bitter after-taste with every single bite. They tasted of stale overused oil. Clearly the fryer oil was being reused way too much and not being cleaned. This is quite unacceptable as it should be very obvious for any cook to notice that the fryer oil is not fit for cooking anymore. \nThe chicken Manchurian had tons of cornflour....both for coating the chicken and for thickening the gravy. It was still edible while piping hot, but as the dish started cooling down...it just became more and more disgusting. \nManchurian noodles were average at best, had a strong flavour of some stock powder or flavouring. So it wasn't to our liking. But I guess that's their recipe. \n \nI do think that the restaurant has the potential to be good. But at this point, a lot of effort is needed on their part. The restaurant is quite popular, and seemed busy enough....which means it must be appealing to the taste of some guests.

If anyone has ever tasted the Lolas beef tips it is also close as you get to original Portuguese cuisine.\n\nNow about Nirvana 2;- it is more about carrying out than dining in. Once you set that expectation you would be fine. Another thing to keep in mind is that not all Indian food is spicy. Anything that involves cream will be bland for the most part.

I only bought two meals worth knowing I should have purchased more and I really should have. \n\nI never go Uptown so my first trip to Nirvana was anything but \"Nirvana\". I wasted most my lunch break roaming around uptown, now on foot looking for the restaurant. It is neatly tucked away in some building on MLK blvd, not really S Tryon, which is probably what caused all my confusion. \n\nBut alas I made it! For my first trip I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala with a side of curried potatoes and eggplant. The Chicken was awesome, the tikka masala was very mild which was nice since the potatoes and egg plant was quite spicy. \n\nI went again today ordering the Chicken Tikka Masala again, the chili chicken or pepper chicken looked great but my stomach has been sensitive to spicy lately, hope that passes.The sides were Aloo Bhindi (potato/okra), Navratan Korma and I got a mango lassi. This all came out to ten dollars, I swear it was pushing five pounds of food. I should have weighed it once I got back to the office. The chicken once again was great, korma was mildly spiced and the pineapple really made it stand out. But the aloo bhindi is what I was excited about the most. I had no idea Okra was a big deal out of the south east, probably because my mid western GF had never heard of it. It was very good, almost tasted like the same spices from the eggplant/potato curry but not as spicy.\n\nFor someone who has recently discovered a love for Indian food and by recently I mean six months, I enjoyed Nirvana II. Sure it's the first Indian restaurant I have ever dined at (Woodlands I am looking at you next) but I think eight dollars, ten with the Mango Lassi for more food than I can eat in one sitting is a great deal.

Gone were the friendly owners, replaced by a new crop of much younger, less interested employees.  I can recall on not once, but at least 2 to 3 occassions going here shortly after 11am for an early lunch and the place was closed.  I've walked in at 11:30 am and they're still setting up? \n\nPrices went up, small changes to the menu items started showing up and the coma-inducing, extra scoops of food that really defined the value of their offering started to wane.  In other words, now you're getting too much food (instead of WAYYY too much food) for $9, instead of $8.  Subtle - but impactful to the discerning lunch goer.  \n\nOne correctable, subtle issue that popped up, and still persists today as I pull another one out of my mouth while chewing and writing this review, is exhibited by the fact that they cook with in-tact, full-sized Cardamom pods and cloves.  Now in and of itself, this is not at all an issue, and in fact encouraged as the subtle flavors are a terrific layer of flavor.  The problem exists when the pods and cloves are not removed prior to serving the dish and so you'll occassinally get a mouthfull of surprise when you bite into an entire Cardamom pod which can simply destroy your pallette for the next several minutes.  It's a rookie mistake, that can be easily changed and make a subtle improvement to their quality.  \n\nUnfortunately, after some serious evaluation of this place for several weeks, if not months (yea I still come here pretty much weekly because it's the closest place to my office) I can no longer recommend this place to folks who may have an Indian food itch burning in their appetites.   The subtle changes that the Aroma management team has made have deteriorated the overall offering beyond my comfort zone.  In fact, the line out the door that used to exist for Nirvana II is gone - the people have spoken!!  \n\nThe other factor here is that Persis Biriyani opened up a place across the street in the Latta Arcade.  In another month or so, after they work out the kinks, I would expect Persis to crush this place on every facet of their offering.

It is nearly a 4...Overall, I really enjoy Indian food and have had it in so many places around the world including Delhi and Bangalore.  \n\nHere is what I like:\n\na. Fast - During lunch, most of the food in their special lunch menu is already prepared and kept warm, so getting your food is very fast.\n\nb.  Selection - Very simple and clear cut. All types of curry and spice levels that you would want.\n\nc.  The ambiance - Very utilitarian in decor, design and feeling. I don't mind it, but it is on the very inexpensive mode, unlike other restaurants.\n\nd.  The food - The most important aspect. I love lamb so we ordered the Lamb Vindaloo.  This is my second time ordering this dish.  The first order time we came here, the Lamb Vindaloo was very mild.  This second time, I asked for it to be hotter and they said it naturally was going to be anyway.   I do admit, the spice was just right and the lamb was very tasty.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was okay, not too inspiring  We also had the Alloo Goobi and this was good, So three dishes between us two.  The naan bread is darn good.  The food is generally pretty decent!\n\ne.  Service - Top notch and will help you to order what you want. Excellent service!\n\nf.  Why not 5 star? I am not sure.  Is it the paper plates?  Is it the fast foodiness style of the restaurant?  Is it the utilitarian feel or the fact that when I am there it is generally empty? Not sure.  \n\nThe food here is good, the lamb I feel is awesome and I will be coming back for sure.\n\nGK says, check it out!

It has been sitting out in the steamers for too long, I think.  Their deconstructed samosa was a bit of a mess.  It doesn't taste like how a samosa should be:  hearty with soft potatoey goodness.  It is too sweet for one.  Maybe they should call it a sweet vegetable and potato plate instead.  The mango lassi was averagely refreshing.  The Chai was made the way I like to drink them.

One of my friend recommended this location to me and said that food is cooked in front of you and the prices are reasonable. I bookmarked this location on Yelp and I finally went for it one day.\n\nIts located on a plaza by 215 and Eastern. This area is always busy with many restaurants in the location, so parking might be a small issue. The restaurant is not lavish like many other Indian restaurants, they have TV where some Indian music is played but over all its atmosphere is more like  Roberto's. The owners are Nepalese, and the food is mainly north Indian with some that have obvious Nepalese fusion to it. \n\nI always get two curries, naan and basmati rice at this location. So far I have tried Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Panner (Spinach w/ cottage cheese, my fav.), Chilli Chicken, Chicken Karai, and their Garlic Naan. I think this restaurant has the most authentic Indian flavor of any restaurant and the food is cooked fresh in front of you. \n\nThis prices are also very low compared to Taj and Mint. and its an excellent place for take out meals. When i first went to this restaurant, they were running a promotion of 20% off the entire bill for only month of March. This made the deals even more special. I also saw that they do deliveries now. \n\nI highly recommend that you stop by to try out their sampler plates (Thali) which come with 1-2 entrees and 1-3 side dishes.

This ain't no pre made frozen samosas, pakoras or naan. You can tell the naan was made with tender love and care, nice and pillowy, I wanted to take a nap on it. it also wasn;t covered in burned bits, like some naan, which I assume comes from a dirty tandoori oven.

Granted, we only used Tandoori Grill's services for take-out (thank God!) but after my experience with them, I swore never to set foot in the actual establishment.\n\nWe ordered the food rather smoothly. However, the restaurant immediately called back to chastise us for ordering one naan, instead of two. In any case, we waited for one hour and a half for our order. The restaurant is 2 miles away, and restaurant promised our order in 40 minutes. Alas, the food arrived....and it was lukewarm....two dishes we ordered were missing, substituted by two other dishes we did not order.....worst thing? The food was not very good.\n\nAfter complaining to the owner of the establishment, he agreed to refund us our money. He requested that we box up delivered dishes and he would come by to pick them up...needless to say, as with the rest of his actions, he screwed up this part as well.\nWe waited until 11 PM for him, and after exchanging half-dozen phone calls, it became clear that he got hopelessly lost and increasingly frustrated. So....we never got our refund.\nThe summary? Tandoori Grille got $70 plus tip and delivery for the tasteless food we did not order... and we spent $70 on the inedible meal and a wasted evening dealing with incredibly rude business owner who somehow felt it was our fault we received the wrong order.\nMy advice:\n1. Please AVOID Tandoori Grill at all costs.\n2. If you absolutely must order froim them....lower your expectations!\n3. Check your order before paying delivery guy....\n4.

The butter chicken had about six tiny pieces of meat and then a watery sauce that would not even hold to the rice. Every thing is still quite flavourful, but very much a liquid - even the vegetable dishes. The lamb dish had too many fat chunks for my taste.

We ordered beef samosas for appetizers. The pastry was crispy and flakey and the filling was perfectly seasoned. We wanted more but had to save room for the main course. Next we ordered a meat and veggie curry (chicken masala and blank lentil curry) with both garlic and butter naan (personally, they taste similar so if you're pinching pennies just go for the butter naan).

I like my curries as much as the next guy but some co-workers suggested I try the Biryani.

My co-worker described it as eating mashed potatoes with rice - personally I don't see the problem). What I found really unusual is that about two minutes after ordering I got a phone call from an unknown number and it was a lady working at the Tandoori Grill. She called to ask me if I wanted my Biryani medium hot or very hot. I told her to make me sweat and I think she might have misinterpreted me as coming on to her.

Minor grievances for me since I do like to experience ethnic and exotic flavours. And boy did she make me sweat! The biryani was spicy too (HAR HAR)!

It can still be spicy and flavorful without it being too hot, the food is just plain mild! Not much variety with spice. I get bummed because they used to have butter chicken in the lunch buffet, but now it's always chicken tiki masala. It's okay, but I like the butter chicken more. They used to have these really tasty meatballs in the buffet as well, but the last 2 times I visited, they weren't there.

All of the dishes seem very chunky and stew-like, different from the sauce or cream mixture type dishes I've seen before with indian food. Also everything had a ton of cilantro on it, and I'm not sure if that's traditional with indian cooking. The tikka masala is good, that's the only think I liked that I tried, but they use green bell pepper for some reason and I don't think that's what a traditional tikka masala uses. The chicken vindaloo was gross and had some gritty substance in it, possibly a piece of bone, I dunno. And the meat seems to be of a low quality. Aside from the tikka masala, which is just chunks of chicken breast which you can't really go wrong on that. I also tried the tandoori chicken, which has a good flavor, but with all the fat and bone on the meat, actually equated to very few ounces of protien. Naan is good, but I've noticed it tends to be burnt slightly most of the time, which maybe they do on purpose but I don't really think improves the flavor of it. This place is ok for the tikka masala but if you're looking for really good Indian food there are better places. I think this place just happens to do alright as it is one of the only places in the west Valley with indian food and so we settle for it because it's close", "name": "Anon"}, {"review_id": "r-msyjYck3aEPytJEZHy11vg", "user_id": "u-hH2Xc-0QBu9mztsrGYSZkg", "date": "2016-08-05 05:57:47", "rating": 5.0, "text": "India garden has great customer service and a delicious set of options on their menu.

The paneer was breaded which I wasn't used to, but I guess that's how it is - didn't deter me from enjoying every firm and faintly cheesy bite.

(We asked for hotter than \"white people hot\", and they interpreted that nicely.)\n\nThe naan was fine, not spectacular. \n\nHowever, the real disappointment were the prices, especially given the mouse-sized portion of rice that comes with an entree. While $30 for 2 is not an expensive dinner, when you are staring at an entree, a side, a peck of rice and a basket of naan, you start to fantasize about the $19 for 2 spread you could be noshing on at the Namaste buffet. \n\nAnd, although we were not there for lunch, they gave us a lunch special menu to look over. There was one under $6, but it is only rice and one entree. No buffet. No deal. I truly wonder how an Indian restaurant can neglect the beauty of a lunch buffet. It is the only buffet I will eat.\n\nIn closing, if you are within walking distance to Mantra Masala, it is probably the best food you could walk to, which might sound like an insult, but I mean it is a 3-star compliment.", "name": "Misti"}, {"review_id": "r-lkFU-IGHwvnfMfM75WNEzg", "user_id": "u-Ig4SpbxDIZwkQR2IPxxnLw", "date": "2016-05-21 02:37:13", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Everything we had here was good.

After a few search from fellow yelpers I decided that Mantra Masala is exactly where I need to be.  Luckily I managed to kidnap 2 buddies of mine to help me \"experiment\" a little bit more since this was my second time ever having Indian food. \n\nBoth my friends were new to Indian food as well I figured I'd order the Mantra's Mixed Grill which consist of most of their specialties for everyone to share; Tandoori chicken, Chicken Tikka, Bazari Chicken, and Barah Kabab (lamb).  All of which were pretty tender and spiced really well.  \n\nOur server looked at us if like that wasn't enough, so I asked him to recommend us another dish to which he concluded that we should try the Chicken Tikka Masala. OMGggg this stuff was amazing!!  I didn't know this, but this is exactly what i've been looking for!! Not Curry! Spiced, boneless chicken roasted in clay oven, cooked in creamy tomato sauce.  I wanted to call my mom and cry because it was so darn good! ;(\nThere were plenty of sauce left that we dipped our Garlic Nan (leavened bread baked with fresh chopped garlic) into it, poured some over rice, and also dipped some of the Mantra's Mixed Grilled stuff into it as well :X\n\nI could see why he wanted us to order the 2nd dishes because the portion were not that big at all.  Just enough which is perfect because we don't need to stuff ourselves with too much goodness.  A tad bit pricier, BUT over at Mantra Masala it's clear that they implement the philosophy's \"quality over quantity.\"\n\nGood stuff all around.. nom nom nom", "name": "Mike"}, {"review_id": "r-gs2bupHiniDqeUyKEW0b4Q", "user_id": "u-ybcBGlRG0qYHI9DbXjfznA", "date": "2009-03-08 21:03:46", "rating": 1.0, "text": "The food I've tried is so/so but nice decor and the owner and staff are very friendly.  \n\nThe naan can be hit or miss here.

Vindaloo is not great, in fact most of their curries (like the Mantra Masala) taste alike just different heat levels.  Have tried the tandoor mixed grill and it was satisfactory.  The malai kofta is decent but the gravy is more like a soup.  \n\nAlso, one thing I noticed about this place is that the dishes are consistently underseasoned.  I read somewhere that most Americans consider Indian food to be salty so maybe this is an overreaction to that?  Not sure.

A separate cold bar had all the fixings, like a simple salad, mango chutney, raita, rice pudding. There was even a small case of chocolate, vanilla, mango, and strawberry ice cream/sherbet.

You could tell that Rajiv loves his restaurant and his job. He made us feel welcome and answered all our questions about the food and restaurant (and the silly Canadian HST tax).\n\nThe next night, we ended up at Bombay Palace again - this time for dinner. Instead of a buffet, we ordered from the menu and were completely blown away. The chicken tikka masala was savory with the perfect balance of onions, tomatoes, and green peppers. My chicken korma was the best I've ever had. Not too sweet, not too creamy, and a wonderful hint of coconut and ginger. The chicken was moist and plentiful. Just thinking about it makes me want to go back to Toronto. At lunch the day before, Rajiv urged us to try the garlic naan. We were so full that we didn't, so we ordered it at this dinner. Words cannot describe the deliciousness of that bread. Most places use too much garlic and overpower the naan; not Bombay Palace.

The pappadams, served with a thick sweet and sour dipping sauce as well as tiny cubes of pickled carrots were a nice little on-the-house appetizer. The pleasantly aromatic navratna korma ($8.95) which I had expected to feature chunks of freshly cooked vegetables disappointingly consisted of only frozen corn, peas, and diced carrots. The saag paneer ($9.95) was as pleasingly thick and richly spinachy as the best with large, creamy cubes of paneer throughout. The non-stretchy naan ($2.50) and the fluffy basmati rice ($4.95) were just okay.\n\nAlthough new bottles of Kingfisher beer ($5.25) were quick to be brought and water refills constant, we were also charged for an extra iced tea that was ordered, but never arrived. \n\nThere were two stalls in the women's bathroom of which neither door locked properly.

My favourite was the coconut chutney because the tomato chutney was too spicy for me. And the potato curry was really simple and delicious. My friend had a upama (hope I am spelling that right) with the sambar and curries however that dosa could have been bigger I guess. It tasted good though, but should have been bigger. Okay so, after the main course, we had pineapple kesari, which was very very yummy. I like simple dishes with top notch quality. Really wins my heart.

Here are the top reasons to go there (I am a vegetarian - so cannot comment on the meat dishes )...\n\n1) Food tastes like homemade, tasty and piping hot. Can be requested spicy which is the way I like it\n\n2) Unbelievable value for money. Anyone who has eaten Indian food in other places in the valley and other cities in US know that to get really good Indian food, you have to pay $$$. Not here. Vegitarian thali's are $6 to $8 (fancier menu). I DO NOT EAT BUFFETS. My personal feeling is like Buffet's are just a huge quality compromise.\n\n3) Food is healthy. I have been eating here since 1999 and not had a bad stomach or any other issues. Like I said dinners are served hot and fresh...\n\nPoints that some people might not like:\n\n1) Owner sometimes looks like he has the burden of the world on him, very sad...\n\n2) Ambience is average as it goes, not something that you look forward to.\n\n3) Very casual atmosphere, so sometimes, we find multiple tables dirty and we just find a good spot and fill water ourselves...Treat it like home.\n\n4) Bollywood songs/videos/programs are telecast. Some people come just for that, and others just sit with their backs to the TV, simple solution.\n\nBut as I am moving out of Phx to Austin, I find that I will miss Kohinoor the most.

We are Asian & know Indian food very well. Big disappointment. Bland, tasteless food. There was no spice or taste. I give it 1 star for many reasons. First let me tell you, I am not one to write reviews, unless I am very impressed with a business or thoroughly disappointed.\nI called the owner earlier in the evening, as I wanted to purchase a Groupon for the Buffet. The Groupon was for 2, 4 or 6 people. We were 3, my husband, myself & My Mum. So I asked her about it as I wanted to know if they offered a Senior citizens discount, so that we could buy the Groupon for the both of us & pay for my Mum.\nShe then told me, that I need not buy the Groupon & that I could come in & she would give me the Groupon price for all three, with drinks included. (that would have been $5 per person for the Dinner buffet.) So I was happy with that.\nWe got there & the place looked dingy, dark & gloomy. With the rain outside, it only made it worse. The food seemed like leftovers from lunch. All the dishes were with curry stains from Lunch. Not Cleaned up. The Rice was just warming up in a rice cooker & it was at the very bottom of the rice cooker, making it obvious that it was leftover. I understand that they can't waste food, but at least, clean up the dishes, so that you respect your customers. The entire place needs cleaning up & the floor needs to be mopped. \nWe looked around & decided to just give it a try, since we were there already. The food was nothing as expected. I was so looking forward to Indian food. Sadly, it was nothing good. Very basic & overall, tasteless.\nWe finished our meal & came up to pay & the lady says, she charged my Mum an 81 year old lady full price of $10 & my Husband & me the Groupon rate. I was like, what's going on? That's not what you said to me on the phone. When I mentioned it, she says she can't do that & also says that she didn't charge me for the drink. Really? I just had a can of Sprite. That's it. She promised us drinks & said they offered anything, tea, coffee, Mango Lassi & all soft drinks & the Groupon rate for all 3 of us.\nExtra $5 is nothing to write about at all. No big deal. Tha would have been our tip anyway, But it's just that you need to keep your word. If the food was exceptional, I wouldn't bother at all. This was basic food. I cook better Indian food at home. And this charge was for an 81 year old lady, who barely eats anything at all. Specially for dinner.\nAll I can say is, they lost a Customer & Many more with us. I am a person who introduces people to restaurants when we find a good one.

One is the traditional menu you see at most places, appetizers, etc.  The other is your ticket to a great meal...a yellow, single sided, laminated menu with their \"specials\".  Unless you are ordering an appetizer, stick with the yellow menu.  It's divided into Vegetarian, Chicken, and Lamb dinners, all with about 8 or 9 options...$3.99, $4.99, and $5.99 respectively!  These are no small dinners either people!  These dinners include the main dish, jasmine rice, naan, a lentil side, a chickpea side, and yogurt!  For $1 more you can add a mango lassi.  For dessert you are welcome to request one of the many items from the bakery, but there will be more than enough food with your meal to fill you up, so be sure to bring your appetite!!  When you are done gorging yourself and have had enough of the day's feature soap opera, just head up to the cashier and tell them what you had, pay, and you are done!\n\nI guarantee you will have some of the best Indian food ever, at THE best price ever, leaving stuffed and happy!  You'll never want to pay $40 for an Indian meal again!", "name": "Heidi"}, {"review_id": "r-i0KgyF5jjVftyr4_Btk6rg", "user_id": "u-bjByM_iS9nRMOvooT_wH2w", "date": "2016-04-02 06:21:03", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I absolutely loved this place!

If I eat gluten I get sick. Dinner becomes a not great experience after a few hours. You can stop reading now if you see where this review is headed and don't feel like my issues are relatable to you. Back to the review. After walking in on the Indian side of the restaurant with my sister and seeing literally no one in the seating area at 6:00pm on a Sunday, we were a little nervous. We tracked down a waiter at the bar on the Bamboo Garden side (1 restaurant - 2 sides, 2 entrances, but they connect in the middle). We were seated in a booth only slightly above ground level and given menus. Being somewhat familiar with Indian dishes and starving after Christmas shopping, we made some selections - birbali shorba (very zesty) and samosa (VERY SPICY) to start. I explained, \"I'm allergic to wheat, my sister can't have nuts\". We were planning on sticking with curry dishes with rice for me and some naan for my sister. The waiter assured me the sauces were prepared only with spices, no wheat, flour, nothing. Granted I've eaten Indian before with success, so I knew which dishes had been previously safe.  But we were trying a new place, specializing in southern Indian flavors. My sister tried the Alu Ghobi (not on the menu but still offered if you ask) and the Chicken Tikka Masala (which was delicious). I tried the Lamb Saag (again, not on the menu but offered) which was the best buttery spinach version I've ever had, as well as the Chettinad an earthy dish with whole chilies. The rice was a bit of a disappointment as it was a tad over done, and the spices cooked with it weren't my taste. By the time we had finished our meal and packed up our many leftovers, more customers had joined us so we didn't feel so strange and alone. All was well...until a couple hours later. I'm not sure where I went wrong, if there indeed was gluten in one of the sauces, or what not. All my cherished leftovers had to be thrown away. I would have given the restaurant 3 stars with a warning to fellow celiacs, but then I remembered the bathroom at the restaurant. Let's just say I've seen nicer bathrooms as truck stops. So 2 stars is the best I can do for my personal review.", "name": "Sam"}, {"review_id": "r-YBWmPD2WMx1Su8a5L60iew", "user_id": "u-nzt7SwH8gXccEa5l_RXRUQ", "date": "2013-10-05 17:24:25", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Great attentive service with a wonderful buffet selection.

I also had naan bread and we ordered two appetizers. My usual- vegetable samosa and something different this time. I can't remember the name of it but it was a fried patty type hash brown thing that had spinach and potato inside it and it was really good! You'll see it on the menu under appetizers - you can't miss it. Just read the description. \n\nMy only complaint- I asked for mild sauce (I know I'm a wimp) but the sauce was pretty hot actually. I'd say it was more on the medium side. I still ate it but I just hate chugging my water or soda after every bite. I like to enjoy the taste of my food- not burn my tongue.

So I took my friend from out of town here for his birthday. Ordering off the menu is not an easy task. First off for the first 20 minutes we were the only customers in the restaurant. The waiter/ bartender/ pretty much everything there kept walking away while we were talking to him. Then when we went to order he second guessed everything. I asked for the Aloo Vindaloo and he said: that is spicy. I said I know I have had it several times. My friend then ordered off of the chinese food menu and the waiter stared at him and said, what? you don't like indian food? The waiter also questioned my fiance's order when explaining her the dish several times when she acknowledged she understood what she was ordering. We ordered the potato cashew rolls only to be disappointed that they had no flavor. They just tasted like unseasoned mashed potatoes.  I then went to the bathroom and when came out the main dishes were on the table. I asked my fiance and my friend to taste mine and asked \"does this taste like there is milk in there? I am vegan so i specifically ordered my food to ensure there was no dairy. When the waiter came back he asked if I liked it, and I said \"Yes. It is good, but-\" And he cut me off and said he changed my order and mixed it with another curry. I asked him if there was dairy in it and he asked me why. I told him I am a vegan and then he proceeded to say it was my fault I did not tell him. Why should I have to tell him when I ordered a curry that did not have dairy in it to begin with? Who changes someones order and doesn't ask? Then not only did he charge me for all of the curry's he brought me (he insisted on not just bringing me the Aloo Vindaloo, which by the way tasted burnt, but another chickpea curry. so I was charged for 2 Aloo Vindaloos and a chickpea curry and whatever curry was mixed in the first one) but I was also charged for 2 different rice dishes because someone brought us plain basmati rice instead of the cumin basmati rice we ordered. My bill ended up being outrageous but I couldn't even discuss it because the waiter would just walk away. A friend came later on and asked for a dirty martini and got something clear in a martini glass. When he asked for some olives they told him they do not have olives. We were afraid to ask how they even attempted to make the martini dirty. I will never go back to this place again. It was a horrible experience.

However, when we walked in - on a Friday night - the place was empty save two small tables. The host cast my mom and I a sideways glance and asked \"Are you here for Indian or Chinese? Cos Chinese is next door.\" We assured him we were there for the curry and were shown to our very long, very low booth. \n\nOur waiter ending being the manager, possibly the owner, so I went with my gut and had him select our courses. He asked our likes and dislikes and went about with suggestions. We started with an \"amuse bouche\" for lack of a better term of chana masala. It was tasty and pleasant way to start the meal. We moved on to our appetizers: samosas and tandoori lamb. The samosas were perfect - crisp, flaky exterior; soft, pillowy interior - and huge! It was the tandoori lamb that stole the show for the entire evening. Four tender chops heartily seasoned with tandoori spice. I think they were too spicy for dear mom - I do believe her spice tolerance has decreased with age (I hope she's not reading this...). They were amazing - perfectly cooked with just the right amount of gamey-ness in the lamb. And yes, you do need a little bit of gamey with lamb otherwise you might as well order beef (but I guess you wouldn't in an Indian restaurant, but anyway...).\n\nAfter our starters we split a basket of regular and garlic nan (don't kiss anyone for at least 24 hours after), plain basmati and tikka masala. I know, tika masala is about as authentic as I am, but it's still tasty and a good intro for mom. Everything was amazing and there was plenty to take home for lunch the next day for both of us.

For some reason I had thought there was an Old Navy somewhere along the line of stores there. Turns out I was incorrect, but I happened to pass by Tadka. I figured, since I'm here and I haven't had dinner yet, why not get some chicken tikka masala. \n\nI had only been here once, when I first moved to Cleveland 3 years ago. I don't recall how my experience was that time, only that I didn't leave upset. I sure as hell remember how it was this time...\n\nI walked into the store and stood by the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign. There were a total of 3 other parties, all sitting at the booths along the right side. All the waitress happened to be huddled together by the POS system chatting. The notice me, and the very nice African American waitress walked up to me and asked me if I was dining in or taking it to-go. I told her I was dining in, party of 1. She asked me if I would like a table or the last empty booth, which one just to the right of me by the door. I told her I'd take the booth. (the restaurant was practically empty, I hate sitting at tables compared to booths, and I figured this would be easiest for everyone since all the customers were sitting in this line of tables).\n\nShe processed to clear of all the extra sets of plates, cups, and utensils. I sat down, while she fetched some water and the menu and told she'd give me a few minutes to look it over. Since I came in with a plan, it didn't take me long to scan the menu and decide what I wanted: 1 chicken tikka masala entree and a side of naan. A couple minutes later, the shorter white, plump waitress came up and asked me if I was ready to order. I gave her my order and she said she would put it right in.\n\nThe order was cooked much faster than I expected,  and within 10 minutes, the 3rd waitress came over with my food, a taller white girl, with strong, masculine cheekbones. She placed me order on the table and left.\n      \n       -At this point, everything had been going swell, I had no reasons to complain and i started digging in.\n\nI had started eating my food and 2 bites in, I decided it would be nice to have a knife. It just so happens the 2 latter waitresses: the plump one and the tall one were  standing by my booth. The plump one was helping a customer who had just walked in and the tall one was loitering close behind her. I looked at her and when she made I eye contact, I asked \"Excuse me, may I have a knife please?\" ---This is where everything started going to s**t.\n\nI had appeared to have struck a nerve with her, sense she looked at me blankly for a good 20 second before say \"yeah...\" She goes to the POS table, grabs a knife and very unenthusiastically hands it to me. I don't expect someone who has to work the dinner shift on a Friday to be the happiest person in the world, but she couldn't wait to walk away, and just kind of hastily handed it to me.\n\nNow, If you've read this far, you'd probably agree that nothing that's happened really warrants a complaint or taking the time to write a critical review. It got worse though.\n\nThrough my entire dinner, she visited all the other booths 2-3 times as she ignored to even come near mine. At some point I ran out of water so I placed the cup on the end of the table so that the next passing waitress might fill it up and I was being super patient about it. She was the only on the area because by this time a bunch of other tables had filled up and the other waitresses were busy there. She looked my direction and specifically at my empty cup several times while she poured more water and refused to come my direction and made her best attempt not to make eye contact. I finally got her attention and asked for some water, and this time she didn't even say a word, she just silently got the pitcher, filled up the cup so fast it almost spilled and left. \n\nBy the time I was done eating, I had given up on getting any attention to ask for the check, so I just sat there quietly till big girl realized i was done eating and asked if I needed anything else.", "name": "Muffin"}, {"review_id": "r-waXPZc74gjoUirflRTUxkw", "user_id": "u-THYhJ6bt_1GIzq_HEigPKQ", "date": "2016-08-01 01:25:54", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Pretty disappointed.

Upon walking in, it became clear pretty quickly that the restaurant was understaffed -- not sure if that's because of the holiday, but other reviews suggest it may be typical. It took a long to get the attention of either of the two servers, and eventually we just grabbed our own menus and plunked ourselves at a table the staff agreed upon that hadn't yet been cleaned up. Our server was, if nothing else, friendly though, and also accommodating to my companion's food allergies.\n\nOnce ordered, the food took a long time to arrive. (Perhaps the kitchen was also understaffed.) Our onion bhaji and chicken pakoras were tasty, but the bhaji were fried slightly too long and so had an edge of burnt taste.\n\nThe main course was a two-curry special which arrived with a generous portion of both rice and naan. I have to give them points for value here ($18 for more than enough food for two people), and the curries were tasty enough, if not terribly memorable. The Chicken Chettinad is a cashew-based dish, which seems somewhat unusual for the typical tikka-masala/butter-chicken menu one finds. The other curry we chose was a Baingan Bartha, which was...serviceable. The special also came with a portion of raita, a slightly soggy papadom, and a decent lime pickle.\n\nI've had much worse Indian and spent more money on it, so I would consider coming back and trying to order some of the other less common dishes, like the special mango fish dish that wasn't available that night.\n\nOne last note: there was a pretty egregious band that played 3 (!) sets while were there, covering all the jazz/pop songs you've heard a million times before in a style you soon hope to forget. It's nice that a restaurant such as this employs local musicians, but if you're going to hire your cousins's daughter's band, at least limit them to 2 sets and turn the volume down so as not to disturb the diners.", "name": "Luke"}, {"review_id": "r-XaNwHucJt8WSNruUTaONyQ", "user_id": "u-cdqUGCBJtbdpkMA2sbfpKA", "date": "2011-03-30 23:05:05", "rating": 1.0, "text": "1.

We purchased a voucher from Living Social worth 50$ so when we arrived for our 8PM reservation the restaurant had a fair amount of people.\n\nWe ordered the non-vegetarian platter as an appetizer, the curry special which consisted of chicken chettinad and beef kadhai and the mushroom makini. It took 40 minutes for us to receive the appetizer. We both thought the appetizer was average but nothing relatively special. We received our meals at 9PM, one hour after our arrival. The curry dish my friend ordered was warm but not fresh, the mushroom makini was fresh but the flavour was too much like I was eating butter. I ate about 1/4 of the mushroom makini because the butter taste was overwhelming.\n\nThe service was below average, we had ordered water and when we wanted more there was no one to ask. Upon arrival the table clothes were dirty and the next table was not cleaned. I noticed there were only 2 chefs in the kitchen, 2 waiters and a manager on a Friday evening.\n\nWhen we received our bill, usually when we have a voucher worth 50$ and we did not spend our maximum we would not need to pay tip or the taxes. But in this situation the waiter told us we had to and it was not included with the voucher. So I had to pay the taxes when the voucher would have covered the overall amount, this has never occurred to me as I have used vouchers in the past and if I have not used over the amount given it would be counted as tip. SO I gave the waiter 10$ and on top of that the remainder of the voucher which is 8$ equals 18$ tip which is completely ridiculous for the service we received.

I have worked in the service industry and also have many good friends who have as well.\n\nNow that that is out of the way, i have to say that this was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've ever had. I arrived at 7 for dinner. it wasn't too packed, the server brought me my menu within 15minutes and things looked okay, although there wasn't a whole lot of selection.\n\nWe ordered and our pitcher of sangria came relatively quickly. An hour and a half later, our appetizers arrived. I was starving and the chicken tikka masala was cold. 45 minutes later, our plates still hadn't been cleared and we asked if our mains were coming. The server mumbled something about how he would check. Then he came back and said that the kitchen was \"chopping fresh vegetables for the meals\" and that was why it had taken almost two hours to come. Then our food finally came and my paneer was beyond bland. After 2 and a half hours, our server asked us for the first time how our food was, and I can't say that I gave a glowing review.\n\nOverall, the food wasn't tasty, dinner (appetizer and main) took three hours, my appetizer was cold, our server didn't try to make things better after they had clearly forgotten about our order (even though it wasn't that busy) and the bathrooms were kinda gross. If I could have given this no stars, I would have.", "name": "Gillian"}, {"review_id": "r-1pzs9ADRD8IfDRxmndYVkQ", "user_id": "u-4zBHyaN_IQYJS23hgp55PA", "date": "2011-02-13 06:03:20", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Went tonight for a friend's birthday. The reservation was for 15, but only 9 of us showed up, which I'm thankful for otherwise I'd probably still be waiting for my food.\nWe arrived at 7:15 and were not offered drinks for half an hour. The drinks themselves took another half hour to show up. Once they finally did we placed our order and realized we may be in for a long night.\nThe server was really nice, but the place was severely understaffed for a Saturday night: 2 servers, 2 cooks and a full restaurant. \nTwo hours after I sat down was when I had my first bite of my samosa appetizer, which was delicious. It would be another 45 minutes before our meals would be on the table. Half of our party was finished eating before a couple of friends received their food. No apologies, no offers, no recognition of how ridiculously long everything was taking. Many tables that arrived after us received their meals et al before us.\n\nThe food was fantastic, which is why I'm giving 2 stars and not 1. The music was cringe-worthy, a catatonic elevator-music band that soullessly covered greats like Hallelujah, I Will Survive and What a Wonderful World. Music that would have complemented the environment would have been more appropriate. After that band a group of people started setting up for a PLAY... Our party marveled at the silence and flickering lights as the actors started constructing their set. Eventually we just couldn't stop laughing; from bad music to no music and faulty electricity,  plus a now 3 hour restaurant experience, and we were all colossally late for the second location of this birthday party (which other people were going to be at who were not joining us for dinner). After the birthday girl finished her meal, she threw down some cash and left to hold the fort down at the tiki bar. NOT the way for a birthday girl to feel.\n\nThe bill organizing was a debacle. We tried to organize a split bill system with our server at the beginning, who told us we'd just sort it all out later. As someone who worked in the industry for years, that is a very bad idea. I figured out my total plus tax and tip and gave my cash before other people were even given their bill. \n\nThe restaurant's grand apologetic gesture came in the form of comp-ing about 6 orders of naan bread, a total of $12. For a group of people ordering multiple drinks and bottles of wine, plus a full meal each, that was pretty measly.\n\nI don't blame the server at all, he was a nice fellow who was working really hard (about 40x harder than anyone else there). The owner really needs to re-evaluate scheduling and have at least two more servers on the floor, a bartender, and three more people in the kitchen in order for the restaurant to run smoothly. I watched people leave after not being acknowledged at the door for over 5 minutes, and a table sat dirty for over an hour before being cleared.\n\nGo to this place...

You know what? They do a darn good impression of my favourite Indian restaurant (also helps that it's 2 blocks from my house and not a $600, 5-hour plane ride away!)\n\nWe just stopped in for the lunch special to give them a shot. We ordered Butter Chicken and deep fried onions (I forget what their Indian food name is).\n\nThe butter chicken was excellent, the onions were also tasty, battered just enough, and came with a few sauces (one was a spicy lime, the other I couldn't place, but both were good).\n\nThe lunch special was like $7.99. For that you got the bowl of butter chicken and 4 pieces of Naan bread. It was perfectly filling for lunch and I was happily satisfied, although I'll need to try it at dinner to see if the portions are larger, given their regular $12.99 price tag (+ naan is extra $ as well).\n\nThey do have various naan's available (butter, garlic, pashwari (sp?), etc) so that is always good. For the lunch special you just get the plain naan, but it was still delicious, and came out to us so hot it MUST have just come out of the oven.\n\nThere was absolutely nobody else in the restaurant at this time (2pm) so we had the place to ourselves. The waiter was fine, refilling our water and bringing our food in a timely fashion. Sure, nobody else was in there, but I still appreciate the good service we received.\n\nWon't write too much about this place just yet, as I've only stopped in for that quick lunch, but I'm anxious to get back there to try it for a real dinner one night.\n\nSo far, a solid WIN.", "name": "MW"}, {"review_id": "r-MUDHjU8B4XCKrR4dRVzWmQ", "user_id": "u-dA4xLSj4stgmHgblQhz0eQ", "date": "2011-11-16 13:35:27", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Ordered take-out for dinner in with friends.\n\nPastry around the veggie samosas was light and fluffy ($3.99) and the chicken pakora was battered perfectly ($5.99).\n\nWe also ordered the Butter Chicken, Aloo Gobi Adrak Masala, and the Lamb Roganjosh.

Once for a lunchtime buffet, which was spectacular, and most recently for a quiet dinner for two.\n\nI would give this place five stars if it weren't for the quirky service. As is the case with most establishments in Madison I've noticed lately, the service is often mediocre, inconsistent, or just downright bad. Unfortunately, in this instance, Maharaja was no exception.\n\nMy dining partner and I were promptly greeted by a waiter at our table. Being that the menu is quite extensive and wanting plenty of time to pour over it, I indicated my indecision and told our server that we weren't in any rush. He must've taken that to mean to disappear for the next 30 minutes. During that time, my companion and I decided on an appetizer and I had some questions. Feeling like we were stranded on an island, I closed my menu a couple times as a lifeline signal. That didn't work. Frustrated, we finally flagged someone over. I was irritated that I could've spent all those wasted minutes noshing while pondering my meal selection.\n\nAfter a bit of a communication issue over the menu, we each put in our individual dinner orders. My companion relayed the drink choice: chardonnay, plus a Coke for him. Seeming confused, the waiter attempted to clarify. I interjected with a chuckle, \"well, not in the same glass of course,\" referring to the soda and wine. Moments later, the waiter returned with a wine for me and what appeared to be a watery-Coke for him. It was obvious after the first sip: the chardonnay and Coke were indeed combined. Ummmm, did this just happen??!! Again our server remained MIA. Finally he returned with my companion's entree. But not mine. About a third of the way into HIS meal, my dinner finally arrived. Sorry, but that is just not acceptable. There was no apology and no indication of the extended wait time. \n\nOur service throughout the meal was spotty, with intervals of more frequent attention and drink refills. It is important to note that we showed up just as they opened at 5pm so the restaurant was not busy at all until a bit later into our meal. The food was very good, and mine was nice and spicy as I had requested.

While I am not sure what it was, I think I found it. I found my breaking point in hot sauces. That alone will bring me back somewhere.\n\nHaving gone on a Friday with a group of woman from work, I really had no idea what i was getting myself into for the lunch buffet. But I decided, heck, I'll try it. Worst case scenario I am out $10. Plus, I figured I had the chance to just try small bites of something I have never had before. \n\nEverything was warm/hot and nothing was sitting out for too long. I wish I could tell you everything I ate, but the two things that really stood out for me were the Tikka Masala and the sausage made with lamb (Which should really say a lot coming from someone who is a faux-vegetarian). \n\nThe only thing that brings down my rating is the decor. I felt like I was walking into a 1980's banquet hall. Besides that, the staff was incredibly kind and helpful. Especially when I started to cry from whatever spoonful of hot sauce I foolishly poured down my throat. \n\nWill I be back? You betcha. Will I eat whatever magical sauce I ate that day? Darn right.

I just want to sit down and eat with no worries. \n\nA simple \"V\" next to all the vegan items would make me feel more inclined to eat at Cafe Krishna, it would make me feel more certain about what I was eating, and it would make the lives for the servers easier not having to run back and forth the kitchen every time I (and every other vegan) have a question about dairy in my food.\n\nThat aside, the food at Krishna can be quite good. I've had crispy, spicy gobi manchurian here and I've had mild, crumbly gobi manchurian. The rasam and sambar is always good. And the dosas are usually a pretty safe bet. I had my first experience with uttapam here, and it was quite good but I'll be sure to ask for no raita next time! \n\nSo, Cafe Krishna, mark the vegan items, and work on a little consistency and you could easily outscore any other Indian join in town.", "name": "Sanjith"}, {"review_id": "r-KL50_N6k5Md--szydhhtMQ", "user_id": "u-aeO2eQXK9riEOQWJpBu3qQ", "date": "2010-03-15 16:15:12", "rating": 1.0, "text": "On a recent trip to Phoenix, my b-i-l took us to this south Indian restaurant for dinner.

I usually eat dosa and South Indian fare at Woodlands (Ray and Rural). I tried Cafe Krishna for a change. I was disappointed. The service was lousy. The waitstaff was not rude and in fact they were very friendly but the wait was too long. We ordered an appetizer and two dosas. They took a 30 minutes to bring us our appetizer and another 30 minutes (1 hour) before we got our dosa. It was not busy when we ordered. There were only 3 couples in the restaurant at the time and they had 3 waiters. They never checked on us and we had to flag them down to get our bill. One of the waiters is an Eastern European woman who spoke no English and had never waited tables before. She brought our chaat to our table and didn't even bring plates with it.\n\nThe food itself was good but not noteworthy. Their chutneys were not tasty or flavorful. The coconut chutney at Woodlands is a lot better. The dosa had very little sabji (potato) filling and was nearly entirely just one large crepe. The dosa at Woodlands includes much more sabji. I did like the sabji and thought it was better than Woodlands because it was slightly less greasy. The samosa chaat was not good. It had very little samosa (maybe two small pieces of one samosa)  and the rest of it included vegetables. It wasn't bad but neither was it tasty.\n\nThe only positive aspect to the place was it's ambience. Despite its \"cafe\" name, the place is a sit-down restaurant. It's nicer than many full fledged Indian restaurants in the valley. It was clean, spacious with many booths. and decorated well. You are seated, given a menu and a waiter takes your order. It's not like Woodlands in which you order at the register. It has a full menu but it's vegetarian. It's also a South Indian place so I wouldn't recommend ordering saag paneer and North Indian dishes because South Indians don't know how to cook North Indian food. \n\nI will not come back because the service was too slow. Even when we flagged our waiter for our bill, there was another couple who had sat for 15 minutes and had not even had their drink orders taken. Honestly, why would I wait an hour to eat Dosa when I can go up the street and eat at Woodlands and get the same quality dosa in 10 minutes. I'm pretty forgiving of slow service if the restaurant is super busy or if there is only one server but this was different. You could tell the waiters had no previous experience waiting tables and had no sense of urgency. They didn't know how to refill drinks, check up on you, bring your bill to you on time. It seemed like they were related to the owner or were part owners and tried to be servers. If the restaurant improved their speed and service, I would recommend this place.

My sweetheart discovered this place through a local Yelp event and suggested I give it a shot. A regular patron of another traditional, homestyle Indian restaurant down in Georgia, I thought I should try out the buffet-style Indian meal for lunch that is prevalent with many of these food establishments. The decor was simple yet elegant. The place was dead; somebody ran to the back to grab the hostess to have my family seated and so there was this odd moment of waiting. However the water was brought out immediately, and I ordered a sweet lassi drink. It was rather delicious; cold, creamy, and not full of ice.\n\nI had to try everything. Mind you, I went back to the buffet line twice after just to make sure what I grabbed wasn't a bad batch or to verify that the food was indeed that good. Mixed results. All the food being served was uncovered, so the heat retention wasn't there and the Sterno cans could not maintain proper heat distribution. Scary thought of food-borne illness. I dove in anyway; trying to get the pieces closer to the bottom of the pan whilst crossing my fingers.\n\nThe basmati rice was great and I grabbed small portions of each entree to sample and stir up the taste buds. Lets narrow down to what I like and didn't like. Here are my personal downs: the salad was slightly browning and the cucumbers were sliced rather thick than I would have preferred, nor did the raita yoghurt dressing helped much with flavor in a bland salad. The daal makahni (black lentils with herbs and spices) I couldn't care for much, though others may find it to their liking. I can't remember how the aloo saag (spinach and potatoes) tasted, but it's another one of those dishes I can pass on since the mushy texture of spinach didn't jibe with my appetite.\n\nThe naan flatbread was a little more than crispy for me, however the tender baked portions were just fantastic! I fancied the onion pakora (onion fritters), chana masala (garbanzo beans with herbs and spices), navaratan korma (mixed vegetables in a cheesy cream sauce), chicken chilli (saut\u00e9ed chicken with onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes)... not a fan of spicy foods, but this didn't make me break a sweat and was one of my favorite dishes, malai wings - I want the recipe for this, mint chutney(!), and tamarind chutney(!). The chutneys were not overbearing in flavor and I couldn't help but to swipe the tasty wings in them with every bite. Had a small helping of the gulab jamun (milk balls in sugar syrup) which tasted like doughnut holes bathed in diabetes. The kheer was a delightful sweet rice pudding to end the meal with.\n\nCheap eats, great variety of food, local, ambient music, clean interior. The basement bathroom could use a little spiffying and it ran ice cold water. Service was excellent, and as it should be since there were only two other tables by the time we finished our meal.

This is the first one that will have me as a repeat customer, over and over again.  \n\nLast night, I went over on a whim for some dinner.  I stuck with what I know: Chicken Vindaloo (Extremely spicy, $11.95), plain Naan bread ($1.95 for a generous portion) and Kheer for dessert, which is Basmati rice cooked in sweetened milk, $3.95).  Let me tell you, the Vindaloo IS spicy.  You will need naan for this.  Wow...the rice was cooked perfectly.  There was plenty of chicken and potatoes in the dish.  Very filling.  The Naan was PERFECT, AMAZING, and absolutely wonderful.  They make their food to order, so you will always have fresh food.  The dessert reminds me of and old fashioned dessert, or grits.  It's quite addicting actually.\n\nI had take out.  The containers are reusable, microwave and dishwasher safe, for those of us who like to recycle.  So, that's a plus.  \n\nMy order took 15 minutes.  Which is awesome for made to order food.  The staff was very friendly.  I met the head chef/owner who came out when I was placing my order.  Everyone had smiles on their faces, and not fake ones. These people really seem to want to serve you this food and proudly they will do so.\n\nWent back today for lunch.  Again, had takeout.  I will try the $8.95 All You Can Eat Lunch Buffet and will report on that next time I go over.\n\nAnyways, today I had the Shahi Paneer ($10.95-Cubes of homemade cheese cooked in a creamy tomato sauce with herbs and spices, garnished with nuts and raisins) - OMG, what a dish.  You can have it really spicy or just medium spicy.  I choose medium.  Once again, rice cooked perfectly.  The sauce is amazing and the cheese cubes melt in your mouth.  I also ordered Pashwary Naan (Bread stuffed with nuts, raisins and coconut - $3.95) - Simply delicious and filling.  This is a great little meal in itself.  Nutty, flavorful, and warm.  This Naan they make is the best I have ever had.\n\nWhen I called to place my order today, the girl remembered me from last night and was genuinely happy I was coming back. Once over there, the owner/chef came out and told me his name (I'm sorry, I forget, I want to say Rishi or something) and thanked me for returning.  \n\nYou walk out of there very happy you visited.  It's a clean place, with excellent food and friendly people.  What is not to like?  It's by far the best new place on W. 9th and there is seating outside.\n\nEnjoy!", "name": "Kristina"}, {"review_id": "r-ChOwGwidKijUNSGpvJTfDA", "user_id": "u-zsB1L0kR0YzaBmMuKsZbjQ", "date": "2012-09-28 16:54:00", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Used a Groupon here, and got so much delicious food!

There were about 12-15 items on the buffet (2 chicken dishes, several hot vegetable dishes, 2 desserts, rice, salad, chutneys, raita, samosas, etc.), and we were pleased with the food.  My husband said the tandori chicken was better than average, and I thought the saag paneer was better than most restaurants as well.  \n\nThe only negative part of our experience were the bathrooms.  The stairwell to get downstairs was absolutely filthy.  The walls are painted white and there is food or something splattered all over them.  The bathrooms themselves also are not very welcoming or particularly clean.  I was glad that I didn't go down the stairs until after we finished because it probably would have enjoyed my food less having seen the state of the stairs/bathroom.\n\nOverall the food was good, and even if the basement could use some attention, we didn't get sick, so the hygeine in the kitchen must be better.

I'm glad a great Indian place opened up in downtown. We went to dinner on a Saturday because a few friends of ours had a Groupon. I think it was $50 for $100 worth of food, which wasn't bad at all. With the groupon, we got 4 appetizers, 4 entrees, 2 naans and 4 desserts. Let me tell you, this was enough food for 8 people. \n\nFirst came the papad, which is a fried appetizer of sorts. It kind of resembles a chip, but with Indian spices and sauces. Next, we ordered a variety of appetizers. I got the vegetable platter, which included a samosa, a veggie pakora, a paneer pakora and sort of a potato patty. For $6, I was expecting something more than just 4 pieces, but it was still very good. Everything was perfectly spiced. \n\nFor entrees, I ordered the Shahi paneer at a medium spice level. It was the perfect amount of heat, and you weren't overwhelmed. It was so delicious, and I was definitely eating it with a spoon. We got two orders of garlic naan, which was THE MOST DELICIOUS THING EVER. Seriously, if you haven't ever tried garlic naan, you're missing out on life.  It was a perfect accompaniment with every entree. The rest of the table got the chana masala, indo-chinese chili paneer, and malai kofta. All were very good. We also got a few drinks as well, such as their chai and mango lassi. Delicious!

Reasonably clean at least, but to be avoided at all costs! They are down in the basement (no wheelchair access I guess) and very dark and cramped. Remember the basement in the Blair Witch Project? So, you know what I'm talking about. The lone toilet stall is so tiny (and with no coat hooks) that you pretty much have to stand on the toilet to get the door closed. And then you can't see a thing because almost no light gets into the stall. The toilet paper is on a weird stick that falls on the floor and lands in... whatever it is that ends up on mens' room floors next to a toilet. So do yourself a favor, don't use the toilet paper. All of which might be tolerable except the light is on a very short timer, with a sensor that doesn't reach into the stall. So you WILL be left in the dark.

The prices weren't high but taking the taste into consideration, i wouldn't pay over $10 for an OK burger and fries. The french fries weren't that great... I had to force myself to eat it; just so i didn't waste food. \n\nService: VERY SLOW. The place was almost empty during the middle of the day but the services wasn't very good. The waiter was slightly stuck-up! He wasn't very friendly but he wasn't rude. He seemed unhappy to be there and serving us. \n\nThe atmosphere: The place looked old like it needs to be renovated.

A few friends and I came after hitting some bars at midnight to grab a bite to eat and have some beers. The waitress (a stubby Caucasian lady) came over and we asked about their beers - she promptly turned a drink menu to us. Then we asked about the shooters they had and she rudely said \"uh like all of them\". Okay. I think part of your job should be to know at least a few of those shooters and beers to recommend to customers. It was apparent she didn't want to be there. \n\nLater on, the bill came to $46 so my friends put down two twentys and a ten. The waitress came over and said \"you need change?\" and we did not. I did not want my friends to pay for me but I only had a $50 bill with me. She saw that I wanted to pay for my own meal so she came over to me and quickly said \"Your meal was $10, if I give you two twentys (from the pile) and take your fifty, then you have paid for your meal\". Me, being a bit buzzed and tired said \"Sure\" and then she quickly took my fifty AND the ten dollar bill. Right away my friend realized \"You know we tipped her $14 for shitty service right?\" I was appalled - it felt like she manipulated me in order to get $10 more tip. I would be ok with tipping 30% IF the server was friendly and actually made it seem like she wanted to be there but she didn't. The waitress didn't come back with the change. I hate being played so I asked the other waitress there if we could have the change back and I would leave the tip on the table. We then watched as the other waitress talked to our waitress in the corner clearly throwing shade and talking shit about us. And boy, did she take her time getting the change. My friends were \"too prideful\" to stay and wait for the change but I'm quite sure she had no intention of bringing it to us. \n\nI use to work as a waitress and I NEVER would assume that I could keep the change nor would I ever manipulate customers to tip me more. The next day I called and explained the situation to a worker there and she took my name and number and said she would call back later - she never did. Obviously, a $10 loss isn't a big deal at all (even though I am a poor student). However, I don't like how she manipulated the situation and took advantage of customers.

Oh god, it's so tough to review this place. Where to begin??\n\nTHE WONDERFUL:\n\n- Choice. Seriously. This place has everything. You can come here for breakfast. You can come here for brunch. You can come here for lunch. You can come here for dinner. You can come here for drinks, finger food, as part of a night on the town. The menu is HUGE. It has everything from Pad Thai, to chicken curry, to traditional sandwiches, to pasta, to burgers, to French toast, to poutine and quite literally everything in between. Oh, and there's a wide range of teas, coffees, juices, beverages, and cocktails.\n\n- The taste! Everything I've tried here (and I've tried a lot - most of the above listed dishes and drinks, in fact) has tasted great. Full of flavour, everything in balance, mostly mouth-watering. (Why am I writing this review just before lunch? Mhmm....)\n\n- Value. This place is as cheap as you'd get in Toronto. I discovered it the first morning I arrived in the city on my visa, and ate there religiously for my first few weeks while searching for a job and an apartment. I would have starved if it weren't for this place! Even when I got a job and moved out to the east end, I still continued to return, as the portion sizes are GINORMOUS, and will keep you full all day. Not only are their base prices well below the city's average, additional deals are offered on some parts of the menu, e.g.: soup and sandwich for 6.75 (or something), add on coffee to breakfast for just 1.75, etc, etc.\n\n- Layout.  It manages to be cosy, yet also inviting to large groups, with most tables offering long benches as seating. D\u00e9cor is mostly Asian, with a trendy, modern twist. There's an outdoor patio for those summer scorchers.\n\nIf choice, taste, value and layout are all you value in a restaurant, then stop reading and consider this place a five-star establishment.\n\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- The service is overall, quite bad. Slow and unfriendly. I had the experience of our waiter not believing we were tipping enough, so he just took our money and kept the residual change without even asking if we wanted any money back. This was after this particular server began to know my boyfriend and I as regulars, so his actions made us feel as though we were stingy and not tipping enough (even though we were leaving moderate tips for the service encountered).\n\nTHE HORRIFYING:\n\n- I can cope (easily) with the poor service, but I cannot accept poor hygiene standards. Unfortunately, I read a recent report stating that the Red Room failed a hygiene and safety inspection - one minor infraction, four significant infractions. I can turn a blind eye to many things, but not to food safety and hygiene standards. For this reason alone, I will not return to the Red Room.

It was pretty bad. It was one of the few times I would have wanted to send it back but our waitress never came to check on us so I couldn't.

I had always ordered a couple of staples, which were cooked reasonably well and filled the void in my stomach.\n\nHowever (and this is a big however), I have since lowered them to 1 star. If I could give them no stars, I would. I eat here fairly frequently, at least once sometimes twice a month and I don't even live in Toronto. Last month I ordered the soup and sandwich deal and was told the soup of the day was either tomato chickpea and cream of broccoli. I usually quite enjoy their cream of broccoli soup, but what I was served (both taste and texture) was more like a wilted old lettuce soup. It was disgusting. I kept trying to eat it, thinking to myself - there's something wrong with this soup. My mother-in-law was the first to pipe up to our waitress about it (whom we tried to track down for a good 10 minutes because no one ever checks on their tables there). There's something wrong with the soup, I tell her. \"Oh, no there's nothing wrong with it - it's actually asparagus soup and I just forgot to tell you.\" Exact words. Not paraphrasing. It was disgusting. I was brought the dreadful tasting tomato chickpea soup instead and just couldn't bring myself to finish it.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning because - wait - there's more. Last week I went in again and decided to order the Phad Thai. Big mistake. I have had the dish before both there as well as from many other restaurants in the Greater Toronto area and have always quite liked the dish.  The dish had two pictures of chilli peppers next to it, which most restaurants have despite the dish being more sweet than it is spicy. I took a bit of it and almost threw up. There was no flavour there - it was just spice. I complained to the waitress who at first gave me a bit of attitude but said I could order something else. I had a strange feeling so I said \"Are you planning on charging me for this food I can't eat?\". \"Of course I am, there's nothing wrong with it.\" She replies haughtily. I tried to explain that it was beyond hot and that it was nearly impossible to eat. It's not normally like this. \"Well that's not our fault, its yours because you didn't read the menu.\" I was aghast and she even brought the menu over to point out the two chilli peppers. She was beyond being explained to and was at a point where she was arguing with me, not letting me speak and telling me that it was my fault.\n\nShe kept telling me I had to pay for a meal that was inedible even by the poorest of standards so I ended up walking out. I had at one point even asked to speak to the owner or manager. She actually smiled at me, crossed her arms and said they weren't in that day. She said she was in charge and that's just the way things are.\n\nI have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before in my life. Yes, the prices are good and the servings are large - but the service is gawd awful to the point where they should be reported to the Better Business Bureau. \n\nThe atmosphere is tolerable on some days and  rank the next - the music being the most obvious culprit. With no standards as to what can and will be played you can be tortured with just about anything your nightmares can come up with - and mid lunch, I just don't want to hear a skipping CD of some woman who is swinging a cat by the tail to drums when all I want to do is listen to the person across the table from me tell me a story.\n\nFor the average student this place may be fine as long as you never have a complaint and stick to the same meal each time. Never complain because it's the customers fault, not the kitchens. Bring some ear plugs or your MP3 player and last but not least, shut up and eat the food they give you....or else.\n\n...or else you can just skip it altogether.

If I lived in India perhaps a modern take on Indian food would excite my palate.  I do not live in India, though.  I live in Charlotte.  Unfortunately, ethnic restaurants in smaller cities have to cater to American taste buds in order to stay in business, and I believe Copper has subscribed to that philosophy.  Nouveau Charlotteans do love anything described as \"modern,\" \"upscale,\" or \"urban,\" so Copper could serve Aunt Jemima pancakes smothered in masala and lure a crowd of identically dressed urban dwellers into their restaurant with the mere description of \"an upscale and modern twist on a traditional pancake.  3 pancakes:  $25.99.\"  \n\nSorry for the tangent....

Both were $7.\n\nNext we ordered our entrees: 2 'modern' vegetarian dishes and 1 non-veg. The goat cheese malai kofta was not flavored or seasoned. The only taste was of the goat cheese. The other veg dish was a tomato-potato dish. This was also the same way. According to the Yelp reviews, the chicken tikka was a must-order. I couldn't differ more on that opinion. The dish was wayy too creamy and not flavored at all. Add to the fact that you can only make the tikka more spicy and not the veg dishes because it's already prepped?! What Indian restaurant has that policy?\n\nNeedless to say, the only things above average were the naan and the secondary waiter's service. Below average was the tasteless food. Copper, please don't insult the Indian diner by serving this food that you call \"authentic and modern.\" And this is before I even got to the price point of the food.

My favorite was the saag paneer $9, it was the most flavorful dish out of all our food. The spinach and paneer were plentiful. I'd get this again, but can't say the same for the other items. Dhal makhani side at $7, not worth it. Every expensive for the portion you get and it was not as flavorful as I had hoped. I've gotten better dhal makhani out of smaller less trendy places. The chicken tikka for $11, I don't think I would purchase for lunch again. I'd have to stick with takeout dinner on this...

We ordered the samosas and side salad which we split, Murgh Tikka Masala and Lamb Chops in Mustard Ginger marinade for our entrees.\n\nThe group we were sat near was quite loud which would not have been a problem if our waiter had spoken up. I had to ask him to repeat himself most of the evening. I was also disappointed he could not recommend a wine to pair with the Lamp Chops. A glass of Menage a Trois blend was quite nice by the way. Type A personalities may be more concerned that a runner brought our salad out as a second appetizer after the samosas (which are wonderful) when we had asked our server for to be served with dinner. The runner also failed to take away the empty samosa plate which cluttered the table. The food itself was excellent but those who put a premium on service should relax expectations.", "name": "Scott"}, {"review_id": "r-9kHHiTD80RHhOHl63krXIQ", "user_id": "u-1VEn9mGPSv2pqvSxBb5Y_Q", "date": "2014-05-27 22:16:57", "rating": 3.0, "text": "Keeping it short.

I expected a lot more, esp because they had such a nice website and interior :P\n\nMy bf and I came here for restaurant week (RW), and upon entering the restaurant around 6pm or so on a Saturday, it was already busy, which is always a good sign. We were greeted by a hostess and lead to a table. It was really dark inside! But the interior was very cute, very romantic and intimate. I liked that. And it was inside a house, which is super cute. I would've given it two stars, but I really liked the interior and the food was decent. \n\nI ordered:\n-Tamarind-Curry Leaf Prawns: These little guys were tasty! I really loved the sweetness of the chutney and the contrast with the tamarind. It was a little confusing at first, because I'm used to eating tamarind in Vietnamese dishes, and it's used a little differently, but I thought the flavors paired well overall.\n\n-Seafood \"MelJol\": I thought the scallops in this were a little undercooked. The dish also got boring pretty quickly. They gave me like four or five scallops, which is generous of them, but the flavors were not something that stood out to me. But, overall, a good dish.\n\n-Chocolate cake: This was their \"house\" chocolate cake. It was kind of dry... And also not as chocolatey as I would've liked.\n\nI honestly don't remember what my bf ordered, and nothing on the RW's website menu strikes a chord, so hopefully what I did review is enough!\n\nAlso, our waiter was pretty terrible. He seemed really young and inexperience. My bf was asking about the Indian dessert option they had on the menu (I believe it was halwa?), and instead of explaining what the dessert was, our waiter just kept repeating, \"It's like halwa. It's like.. um, halwa.\" My bf started asking about ingredients (\"Is it the flour-y... or nutty...?\"), but our waiter kept responding in a non-helpful manner. \n\nLastly, their RW menu says, at the very bottom, \"$30/person including tax and tip.\" Clearly, that cannot/was not true.

Our server was no where to be found most of our meal on an uncrowded night.  Our wine glasses were empty for quite a long time prior to food arriving...we tracked him down...but barely got him to stop for a moment and ask for another glass.

Oh and just skip the pakoras which have no substance at all, and the aloo tikis are not made properly either, they are way too dry.

Now don't get me wrong, the rice and its even sexier sibling coconut rice is just fine here, but the freshly made paratha bread straight out of the over is at the top of my list as the best wrap bread I have ever tasted.\nIt's rich in flavour and infuses palatable elements of other delectable flat breads like nan into a stretchy, chewy masterpiece which surrounds your choice of sumptuous fillings like butter chicken or various vegetable masala's in what quickly becomes a textural delight upon completion. \nTo top it off, every paratha wrap is served with very fresh standard veg like salad and tomato's and some unique options like spicy marinated carrots and your choice of a variety of amazing sauces like tamarind and hot sauce. \nLast but not least, it's very important to mention the absolutely gargantuan size of each paratha wrap which, to put it in ethereal terms, is roughly the size of a medium human head and feels like it weighs a good kg and a half. Thankfully, it does not feel that heavy in your stomach because of its wealth of healthy ingredients and the high quality of the ingredients used, Also, for those looking to get their money's worth, the massive paratha wrap is often large enough to be divided into 2 separate meals if you are not exceptionally hungry. \nI would recommend the Caribbean Chicken if you are looking for something with meat and the potato curry if you are looking for something vegetarian. I almost exclusively get the potato curry because I think it's not only the best tasting and most filling option on the menu, but it also happens to be the cheapest at $5.95.

A bit in the pricier side compared to the adjoining food stops, but, this is far more interesting, tasty, and independent.  So, there.  The BBQ chicken wrap comes in a giant portion, rolled up in a slightly chewy, soft paratha wrap, either white or whole wheat.  The chicken is fresh, cooked to order, ANC mighty good.  Add in some handsome offerings of lettuce, coriander, some achar (spicy pickled veg), and hot sauce, and you are off to enjoy.

My favourite tends to be the spicy beef wrap, though the BBQ chicken tikka wrap and the butter chicken wrap are both delicious too -- the butter chicken is the best bet for someone who does not like things spicy. The paratha (bread) itself is absolutely scrumptious.\n\nOnce the bread and filling are ready, you can choose which toppings you'd like to add. These include lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and (very) spicy carrots. There are yogurt and tamarind sauces as well. Beware the carrots! They are delicious, but will be too spicy for some people's tastes.\n\nThe vegetarian samosas are cheap and delectable as well.\n\nEverything is made to order, so you may have to wait for 10 or so minutes for it to be ready. You can call in an order to pick up, but I have had mixed results describing what I want and getting it right.\n\nOn the whole, I love having the option of grabbing a bite here rather than the standard fast-food options nearby.", "name": "Jon"}, {"review_id": "r-ttKUf1zsrOcyg0n-wSG97A", "user_id": "u-ETZqYM1WSy9VXGxpkC7kKQ", "date": "2015-02-16 03:23:49", "rating": 4.0, "text": "BBQ Chicken wrap is good specially their spicy carrot topping!!!

Shortly after placing our order, however, a party of three and a baby were seated at the table right next to ours -- despite the fact that there were many, many other empty tables in the joint.\n\nNow, here's what I've struggled with. Do I make this review all about our experience next to this table of inconsiderate diners? Or do I focus on the food alone? I've decided to go with the former, since the staff felt it was okay to place a small infant at a table *right next to another one* despite ample space in the restaurant.\n\nMy appetizer, the Chicken Ginger Tikka (Chicken breast marinated in lemon juice, crushed ginger & garlic, cooked over charcoal), was actually pretty good and I did enjoy it quite a bit. It was only after I'd finished eating it that the aforementioned baby really started to express its displeasure at being out of the house.\n\nThe baby wailed for a solid half hour (and probably kept going long after we'd left). Nobody at the table made any effort to shut the baby up, and in fact, they all just started talking louder. The staff not only didn't do anything about this, but basically ignored our table for the rest of our meal. I would've ordered another alcoholic beverage, but nobody asked if I wanted one. Worse still, our water stayed empty right up until it was time to pay the bill.\n\nMy main was the Shrimp Masala (Tiger shrimp saut\u00e9ed with peppers & garlic in tomato & onion masala) and my dessert was the Gulab Jamun (Dumplings cooked in light syrup with saffron & pistachios), but because of the absolutely intolerable ambiance, I was forced to wolf them down in an attempt to get the hell out of there. (I should note, however, that the shrimps were not peeled. The laziness of the chef meant that I was forced to spend a few minutes attempting to peel each of the four or five shrimps, with the endeavor made all-the-more difficult by the sauce that they were soaked in.)\n\nAll in all, this was one of the worst, most annoying meals I've had in a very, very long time. Neither of us enjoyed our meals, since we raced through the entree and dessert portions.

The dish could've been spicier but it defiantly was awesome. There were strong notes of cardamom which wasn't a big deal, but they could've toned down a bit.\n\nPaneer makhani ($10)- Small tender pieces of cubed cottage cheese drowned in a fenugreek tomato curry sauce and thick butter. I thought this dish would be too greasy but it wasn't. The paneer makhani was my favorite dish and the flavors were bursting!\n\nNaan ($2.50)- The naan bread here was fluffly, a bit stretchy, and super fresh. It really went well with our mains.\n\nDessert/Drinks:\nI tried the mango mousse ($5 or 6) which had a thick creamy whipped cream texture bursting with fresh mango flavor without being too sweet. The dessert was pretty tiny; it could've been bigger especially for the price.\n\nThey had a nice bar menu but we opted for the lassi ($3) and masala chai ($2). The lassi was semi-sweet, chilled and creamy with yogurt, and the masla chai was super fresh and hot! I was afraid they'd give me microwaved stuff like other Indian restaurants.

I of course got some tikka masala, my go to, and tried the lamb curry, and a few other things I cannot recall the name of. I took my first bite of the tikka, and spit it out. It was like taking a shot of salt. Everyone else did the same. It was inedible. At least 3 of the other dishes were just the same, the only flavor was salt. Overpowering loads of salt. And on top of that, they had the heater on the buffet set really low or even off, if they food had been any cooler I wouldn't have even tried it, for sanitary reasons. One of the managers stopped by to ask  how the food was at one point, and I was honest with him. He did offer to have a batch of \"low sodium\" tikka misala made up, which came out piping hot.

Eating at the lunch buffet I got to try a good variety of things, and all of it was pretty darn tasty.\n\nI was let down by the chai tea, there was not very much flavor in it at all. Sadly it was more brown water than anything else. Didn't get any other drinks so I can't speak for them, the rest may be good.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant isn't enjoyable currently, though this is mainly due to remodeling they're doing I think. There's not really any decorations on the walls, so apart from the tables the rooms feel empty. But again, they're currently remodeling, so this will likely improve over time.\n\nThe waiter felt very awkward and almost confused. And I don't think I'd put it to him being new to waiting tables. He had the motions down so to speak, but he didn't seem to know what was going on. We asked if we paid at the table now or on the way out, and he didn't seem to know. After a long pause, he said it was paid at the table, but he sounded very unsure. And throughout our interactions with him, there was never a spark of personality.\n\nSo comparing it to Maharaja, which it took the place of. Is the food better? Maybe some of it, yeah. It's the same if not better. The chai is worse, though the rest of the drinks may still be good. The atmosphere currently is a far cry from Maharaja. Empty walls and lack of any decorations make it feel unenjoyable and less fun. It lacks the charm that Maharaja had. And I can only speak for one waiter, but comparing him to the waiters of Maharaja, there's no contest. The waiters of Maharaja had fun personalities and were nice and very attentive, even at the lunch buffet where they're needed much less. The waiter I had seemed like he'd rather be anywhere else.\n\nThe three stars are because the atmosphere, and staff will likely improve over time. And the food is already good. It has the makings of a great restaurant that will stand on its own and not need to be compared to its predecessor. When that happens, it'll be a 4 or 5.

Food was good and the quality was good. Probably a 4-star had they been more accommodating.\n\nReview: I was a little hesitant to try Namaste since I'm used to a more traditional setting for Indian food, but since I'm down with Indian food and always like to see vegetarian restaurants survive and thrive, I gave it a shot.\n\nOn the positive side, the food had familiar flavors and seemed to be of good quality. No complaints there. The gentleman who took my order was friendly and helpful and the 3-ring binder with photos of the food was a nice touch.\n\nI typically order my food (Thai, Indian, Mexican, etc.) at a medium spice rating. Apparently \"medium\" here is quite a bit hotter than what I'm accustomed to. Keep in mind that this is based on only one visit here, but I will definitely be trying \"mild\" next time.\n\nOne slightly disappointing aspect of my visit came when I explained that the dish was much spicier than anticipated. I had eaten about one third of it before reaching a point where I couldn't go any farther. It became apparent that they were not willing to remake the dish -- something that is a pretty standard accommodation when there's an issue such as this. He offered a couple of other options, the first couple of which didn't help. Finally some veggie rice was extended and that helped to tone things down a little bit.\n\nIn the end, I wasn't as happy as I would have been had they simply offered to cook up another dollar worth of chickpeas for me, but I'll be back to give it another try.", "name": "T."}, {"review_id": "r-YY-zVwU-YtzAcvN21rQ4JA", "user_id": "u-otnjf1PsH_sLVC13K2KAbg", "date": "2018-07-29 01:35:32", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I've eaten Indian food in Scotland, Australia, England, America, Thailand and elsewhere.

Can be customized for spicy like any restaurant but what makes this one different is that the medium spicy is not so much that you can't eat but enough so that you get some flavor out of it. A little kick if you will. \nSo why is it 5 stars? \nIn my opinion, it is the first Indian restaurant in North America to give a good Malai Kebab. So that's one star. \nEverything is made fresh, and the servers are very friendly. Another star. \nThey have an outside seating as well, and I think the view from there of the streets are just gorgeous. \nThe food is again, very good. I ordered naan, garlic Naan, roti, and onion kulcha which were very good and very fresh. Can be made as crispy as you want. 4 stars now. \nI also ordered Palak(Spinach) chicken medium spicy. Again it's just enough that you get a good kick and it's good for those who aren't used to spicy food. A medium spicy Palak Chicken is the way to go. \n\nLast Star. \nThe inside is very authentic both French and Indian. The lighting and ambience is perfect at any table, and for those legal to drink (not me at 19, but you maybe) there is a bottle if you want it. Of course this restaurant is Bring Your Own Bottle if you'd like too. \n\nThis restaurant is a little upscale in my opinion. I am a student so I have to watch it. But for $29 the restaurant offers a good three-fer deal. \n\nAnd a bonus star I'd say goes to the cleanliness of the washrooms and the down to earth professionalism of the staff. \n\nGreat place to eat and one of the best kebabs I've had to date.

Obviously, I found this place on Yelp since that's my go-to when I'm unsure of quality and service. Today, I ordered the chicken tikka to go. I was the only customer there, and the lady said about 25 minutes (keep in mind that all the staff were sitting and eating together at a table). I figured fine, it would take a while for my food...15 minutes past, and the staff finally got up from the table and all went to the back. First of all, did I really have to wait for my food to be made because nobody wanted to get up and prepare it? Secondly, why does everyone have to go together to the back and leave me alone questioning where my food is? Anyway, after about 5 minutes my food was finally ready and I left. \n\nOnce I got to work and was about to dive into my food, I realized, they didn't supply me with any napkins or plastic cutlery. Woopty doo, how would anyone be able to eat their food? Whatever it was fine, I found a fork in the kitchen at work. The packaging for the take out food was very interesting...remember how I said my food was basically prepared in 5 minutes? Unless if they have some packaging machine at the back of the restaurant, my food literally looked like it had the same packaging as those in microwaveable food. You know the black plastic tray then the clear plastic film on top? That's exactly how I got it. Pretty odd to me. Wasn't very much helpful either when I couldn't finish it all during my work break and had to take it home...no cover for my food obviously! \n\nLastly, I'm not sure how usually Indian food is priced. As I said it was my first time. But anyway, I feel like it was pretty pricey for the amount of food I got. I paid in total for the chicken tikka and a can of Coke, a little over $19. \n\nDon't know if I'll go back here. Maybe if I'm in the area and want some Indian food.

I have eaten here on many occasions my guests and I have always enjoyed our meal and the experience. \n\nReligiously, I will start my dinner with an order of beef samosas. They arrive at your table piping hot served along side some stellar tamarind chutney. The beef filling is bountiful and seasoned well; these will forever be a staple of mine. From the tandoor I would typically select the chicken tikka, seekh kebabs or paneer tikka. For mains the butter chicken here will make the cut every time. The blend of masala and spices is near perfect and the boneless chicken pieces are tender and definitely pre-marinated. I've eaten butter chicken everywhere, and BC's BC holds its own.  \n\nIt is important to note that if I were vegetarian I would be most pleased with this restaurant. I find most veggie heads love paneer, as do I. Bombay's Chutney boasts 5 vegetarian curries which showcase paneer: Chili paneer, paneer makhni (butter sauce), saag paneer (spinach), karahi paneer and mattar paneer (peas). In addition to the plethora of paneer dishes they have several other vegetarian ones including my absolute favourite, Malai Kofta. \n\nTo accompany the dishes you can order biryani or naan. Unfortunately I have never tried the biryani because their garlic naan has always been way too spot on to deviate away from. The naan is brought to your table straight from the tandoor and is always perfectly cooked. If you order the garlic rendition it will be brushed with butter then absolutely riddled with garlic bits before going into the tandoor. The garlic bits caramelize and crisp up and my goodness it's perfect.  \n\nOverall a solid experience each and every time I visit this venue. The only quam I have with BC is that they now have a huge sign at the front of the establishment advertising a $4.99 lunch, I feel that this takes away from the class of the restaurant a bit, but you gotta do what you gotta do. \n\nService is always awesome and they have a bar complete with various wines, liquors and beers including Kingfisher!

I'm not sure how long they were without power but I suppose this could be a potential explanation as to why all of the meats were smelling....sour. \n\nI'm very disappointed that anyone could serve the shrimp that I smelled and if the people running the kitchen can't tell the difference between good meat and bad meat then they shouldn't be running a restaurant because they're going to kill someone.

I always liked the place.   I thought I should share my opinion with all yelpers.\n\nThis place is in Green Tree area.   Place is really nice and cozy.   They have a party room available on same premises.   If someone wants to have a party for 25 people, they provide you enough private place and cater food.   Parking is a bit struggle though.   It's in a strip mall where parking is shared with bunch of other places.\n\nStaff is very well managed and they are always ready to help you if you are new to Indian food.   The owners are from South India and so the food is inspired by the south indian receipes.   They also are very flexible with how much hot/spicy you food you want.  So tell them up front and they make sure your taste buds are not burned.\n\nThey have some great appetizers.  Chicken 65 is my dish.   Other appetizers are also great and sometime we order too much those since everyone has there own preference.   If you like hot/spicy stuff, order  \"Cut Mirchi\".   These are chiilies deep fried in a lentil batter served with onions and lemon.  Excellent!\n\nThe Rice dishes are also very authetic and one should give it a try for their biryani items.   Biryani is Indian version of paella.   They serve pure veg biryani as well. \n\nChicken curries are excellent and we always like dish called Chicken Curry.  Chicken Tikka Masala is also another dish you can't go wrong with.    Veg entrees are also excellent and we like spinach with panir, channa masala.   \n\nBreads are also well prepared and you will be happy no matter what bread you get.  I love their butter naan.\n\nOverall they do a excellent job and prices are very reasonable.

The gobu manchurian is a bit spicy for the average person so beware, you only get 4 gobis. The navaratan korma is very flavorful and the creamy sauce goes well with the naan; however, i was a bit disappointed that the amount of vegetables was so minimal.

Everything was fresh and prepared exactly how we had requested so we were excited to be back. We live in Henderson and made the drive here to eat here again. We walked into this restaurant around 9pm for dinner with my parents and grandparents. We ordered a very basic dinner of Dal Makhani, Chicken tikka masala, Tandoori chicken, a couple of roti and a garlic naan. It's really hard for us to judge spice levels in some Indian restaurants so we always order medium. When the tandoori chicken arrived it was bland, and I mean like completely bland to the point where we were drowning it in mint chutney. We asked our server to change the spice level on our entrees since medium was bland. So food arrived and guess what. It was bland! We asked the server whether he had changed the spice level in the kitchen and we didn't quite get a clear answer. My grandmother tasted the Dal and she almost spit it back out on her plate and stated that it tasted old like it had been reheated and the consistency was off as well. Dal is supposed to be bisque like consistency and it was just this unappetizing blob. The owner happened to be around and my dad told him that the food was terrible. The owner offered no apologies but instead offered to reheat the dal and make it spicier. We quietly finished our \"dinner\" and made it very clear to the server that we wouldn't be back he didn't seem to care. My grandfather hated it so much that he actually said eating off the Dollar Menu at McDonalds would've been a better dinner. Needless to say I wouldn't return to this place ever again.

I had been searching for an Indian buffet nearby  thank you to whomever added Angara as a business for ending my search.\n\nAngara is on Grand Canyon behind McDonalds, next door to Tropical Smooth and two doors from Bite. \n\nBuffets is available only during lunch and is only $10.99/person. If you have never had Indian food, this is a very good deal and allows you to try all the popular Indian dishes. In fact, I recommend trying a little bit of everything. The staff at Angara is very helpful. If you wanna know about a dish, they are more than happy to answer your questions.\n\nAs you are seated, you are offered two types of naan, plain or garlic. I chose plain as I had to return to the office, and I wanted to be sure I could taste the flavors of the other dishes.\n\nAt the beginning of the buffet, they have large sized samosas (my all time favorite, Indian pastry filled with potatoes and peas),  followed by the vegetarian entrees like Saan paneer (my all time favorite Indian vegetarian dish, creamy spinach with cheese cubes),  lentil and eggplant dishes. I'm not a hot/spicy dish person. In the past, I have known saan paneer as a mild dish, but Angara makes it spicy that I had to eat it with the naan instead of the rice. \n\nUnfortunately, because I filled up on the samosa, vegetarian dishes, rice and naan, the only meat dish I could get to was the chicken tikka. Proof that one can get very full on vegetarian dishes alone. Next time, I'll have to start with the meats. Other meat dishes available were chicken tandoori and goat curry. One dish I wish they had is fried fish bites.\n\nAt the end of the buffet were desserts that I'm unfamiliar with, but will try in a future visit, and  regular house salad which baffles me with all the vegetarian dishes available, but to each his/her own.", "name": "Edith"}, {"review_id": "r-hvzmYeevNqZe4S8GuAIGGQ", "user_id": "u-bJltnzbkslg8gWYva3TIlg", "date": "2016-09-19 02:04:13", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I,ve came in the buffet for the first time today...and loved it..the naan and chicken tikka masala was one of the best ive ever had...our server(name MOTI) gave unforgettable service...he explained everything whatever they put in there buffet..due to my first visit ,it was really helpfull for me to know about there curry's.the restaurent was neat and clean from in side as well the outsite...will for sure ill be back again and i highly recommended this place for those who never had try indian food.", "name": "RJ"}, {"review_id": "r-lV0qs6KRRDbT25aAvUZgrA", "user_id": "u-ZuWAof5l6yKeft-F1QCWSQ", "date": "2016-01-18 06:49:06", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I hope this place is here to stay!\nIt's new, cozy, and not too loud.

We ordered the food & the lady behind the counter was nice, I could tell she was trying. The service was actually pretty good and the food came out quickly which I was very happy about. \n\nUnfortunately what the food came out in was very very very disappointing. Plastic dixie bowls and styrofoam plates. It should be a crime for any resturant to do this. Mind you I was not getting take out, we sat and ate in the resturant. When I asked the nice lady for silverware she said they only have plastic forks and knives. This is one of their biggest fallbacks in my opinion. Plates and silverware is not a big ask.\n\nThe food was actually pretty good. The vegetable samosas were tasty as was the chicken tikka masala and the tandoori chicken.

The food was definitely tasty & our server was super sweet, shes the owners daughter.

Also, it was cooked with boneless thigh meat which was a nice touch because it was super tender.  We also got the veggie samosas which my husband loved, and the garlic naan which was pretty good as well. Unfortunately, i have to give it three starts because of the quality. All the food was served in paper/styrofoam plates which really threw me off. My husbands super picky about stuff like that so he definitely did not enjoy after that. They only had plastic utensils.  I understand if this was a fast food restaurant, but it isnt. Youre meant to sit down and eat a meal there, and the plates and utensils really threw all of it off. .

The inside of the restaurant is well lit and well decorated - cool bar areas with lots of different types of gin to choose from. We were seated quickly at a booth and ordered our drinks and dinners. I got the Blackberry Bramble which was super tasty - fruity and refreshing! I also ordered the Tikka Grilled Cheese w/ Curried Coconut Tomato Bisque (such a mouthful) while my two friends both got the Tikka Masala. The food came out quickly and was fresh & hot. The friends enjoyed their Tikka Masala - spiced well and had some heat to it! The grilled cheese & bisque was also very good! The bisque was very heavy, so even though the dish didn't look huge, I was pretty stuffed!\n\nFor dessert, the two friends got the cheesecake and bread pudding. Cheesecake came wrapped in a puff pastry thing (we nicknamed it \"The Cheesecake Poof\") and a side of fruit puree. The cheesecake was super soft and delicious and went really well with the puff pasty! The bread pudding was very dense and well spiced! The garnishes of cranberries, raisins, and dates were also a nice touch. \n\nExperience was very good overall! Service was relatively quick and very friendly. The food didn't blow me away but was definitely enjoyable, and I'd be interested in visiting again to try more dishes.

But this imperfection seems inevitable when you are trying to fuse Indian and British pub food.  The real question is--will it continue to get better?\n\nI would call the food overall a solid 7.  (I would like to note here that this is often the case for even the most \"in\" restaurants--inconsistency is everywere).  The drink menu, however, is a 9+.  My guest, and others in the restaurant, were loving the mixed drinks.  $10 for a lot of creativity and kick.

Annalakshmi has a decently sized Dosa menu consisting of different variants of Dosa to appease each pallet. I went for the Madras Dosa which was quite amazing, it had robust flavours and tasted quite spicy! As an accompaniment I had the Onion and Chilli Bajjis which were slightly oily but still tasted good. You also have the option to customize how your Dosa is made (less oil, more oil, extra crispy, etc.). That is something to note if you like your food a certain way. \n\nService is always great here, the staff always greets you with a smile and are very courteous; something generally not found in smaller ethnic restaurants from my experience. \n\nI would definitely check this place out if you want to get your Dosa craving fixed!", "name": "Ahad"}, {"review_id": "r-9_i1YPI1tFnxsk10b5LbZQ", "user_id": "u-KVU-0u6ma74F4II9EOMAcw", "date": "2019-02-11 16:59:02", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Wow just wow for the delicious food!\nWe headed to Annalakshmi on a Saturday afternoon  as were were craving for their dosas and what took us by surprise was to see how busy they were!

This is not authentic Indian food - we don't have rice and salad bowls - but it is good, wholesome, high quality Indian food.\n\nI ordered a bowl of rice, yellow daal and the koftas (meatballs). The daal was perfect, the way daal should be cooked. The koftas were a little bland for my taste, but otherwise not bad...soft and the right texture. Paired with the many sauces and onions and the whole dish was wholesome and rich and very filling. My friend ordered the biryani, which, while not bad, still isn't the way real biryani should be, and I come from a city known for its biryani - but then I still haven't found a single place in America that makes biryani the way they do it back home.\n\nThe ambiance is good and there's plenty of room to sit. The line moves quickly and at most you'll face a 10-15 min wait on a crowded day. The only issue I had was with the music - being a designer, it bothers me that the music selection to go with such great interiors  could have been better...I would expect Bollywood classics or Indian classical fusion instead of the usual loud pop music.\n\nTldr: if you're looking for authentically prepared and presented Indian food you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for high quality Indian-American food, this is a great place to get it. Will be coming back to try their tikka masala and chicken next.\n\nUpdate: went there again with a bunch of friends and tried their chicken tikka masala and pav bhaji.

I want to love this place because the format reminds me of my favorite Indian restaurant chain in Austin - Tarka. Unfortunately, I've been kind of disappointed in the food and dining experience.\nBoth times I went, it was totally packed inside. Sure, it is new, and people are excited to try it. The space is vast - well, the vertical space is. Seating space, however, is pretty limited and cramped. Some parts are right up against the windows and line, and there's little room for patrons to move around, get toppings, and employees to bus the tables. It is also quite loud. They play music that sounds like you're shopping at an H&M.\n\nAs for food - it isn't bad. But also, it really lacks that punch of flavor that I've come to expect and appreciate from Indian food. It really tastes like they dialed back the spices and heat to appeal to the midwest palette, and I'm not very happy about that. They don't offer any spice level when you order - but do have some hot sauces in the condiments area. Unfortunately, those just aren't the right flavor profile - they taste more on the tabasco pepper side of the sauce spectrum, and less on the delicious hot curry spice side. It's just not the same.\n\nMango lassi is delicious.\nSamosa chaat is also quite good.\n\nI wish they didn't use so many disposable plates, cups, plasticware. Another negative compared to Tarka.\n\nAll in all, I think this place is a fine quick alternative to, say, Chipotle, but if you really want quality and interesting flavors - look to one of the old-school restaurants like People's Indian, Tamarind, or All India.\nIn reality, I can get in and out of People's Indian just as fast as here.", "name": "Brian"}, {"review_id": "r-PPhbu5dnccbSzjZFPwLdPw", "user_id": "u-WOLqQKPrux3cYZFQnxnpqQ", "date": "2018-02-11 16:44:10", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I have visited the place yesterday.

We both agreed that we would use order ahead on our next visit. \n\nNow here is where my frustration is mixed. Part of the reason the line was moving so slow is that cashiers were guiding customers through the menu in such excruciating depth that orders were taking multiple minutes to put in. One cashier actually brought samples of each masala to a group of four so they could taste before ordering. While I appreciate the commitment to customer service and satisfaction, this was frustrating to watch. I would rather see samples be given in a separate location so customers can make informed decisions before standing in line. \n\nNow for the actual food: On my first visit I got the Perfect Balance bowl with Tikka and Lamb. It was exceptional. The lamb was perfectly cooked and the sauce was the perfect pairing. On my most recent visit I ordered the Choolaah salad with Salmon. I wouldn't normally order salmon at a fast casual restaurant, but the strength of my first visit encouraged something out of the ordinary. It was quite good, though not as a good as the Perfect Balance. (Note that this is probably due to the fact that I rarely, if ever, feel fully satisfied after a fish meal.)\n\nOverall Choolaah is great. Its ordering system is a little slow (definitely consider ordering ahead!), but that can be worked out.", "name": "Rich"}, {"review_id": "r-ES7TOddCM3QnXbn6zGiVtg", "user_id": "u-1ZPnQs-tdvbX8ROjtnzcEg", "date": "2018-02-25 01:47:31", "rating": 2.0, "text": "I feel bad giving Coohlaah 2 stars, but I think it comes down to the fact that Indian food just isn't my \"thing\".

If you are an Indian food lover, I think this would be a must visit!  \n\nThe atmosphere inside is very trendy and clean. I love that you could see inside the kitchen and watch them make the naan- that was a fun part of dining here! It's also huge, with seating downstairs and upstairs so there is enough room to be comfortable with a large crowd. All of the staff here was super friendly and helpful with the menu & provided a nice experience for us. \n\nAs I said before, this was actually my first time eating Indian food so I didn't know what to expect. Chris and I both ordered the \"bowls\", he got the lamb and I went with chicken. The bowls came with rice & the tandoori vegetables as well. You can pick any of the masala sauces to put on top of your bowl, I chose the only one I was familiar with which was the tiki masala. They also had a few sauces to add on the side that were all unique. The sauces were the only part of my meal that were actually spicy.  We also ordered a side of naan that was delicious!

What we loved about all the options were the distinct flavors and then the options to add the sauces to spice them up. We also tried the two kinds of lemonade available, mint ginger and mango. The mango was very mango-y (that's a word, right?!) and the mint ginger was just a hint but was very refreshing.\n\nSo the food: Good!

Friends in Mississauga raved about this place. Being a frequent customer of various South Indian restaurants around the city, my palate is very familiar with this cuisine, so Guru Lukshmi had better measure up. In my opinion some of the best South Indian food still resides in Scarboro..but let's give sauga a chance :p\n\nMy first impression of this place was that it wasn't really much to look at, but who came here for looks? Surely I didn't. I mean you could tell they did try to give it that sophisticated look, but with the table arrangement, it doesn't work.\n\nFirst and foremost, this place is small!  I mean really small. So don't invite a big gang or show up with a party of 10. The place was busy, we got seated quite promptly. Maybe its just me, but I found the seating not comfortable at all. It was like I was kinda leaning forward! The service was excellent, organized mayhem is what I would call it. When it looks like everyone is confused and doesn't know what is going on, the place still hums along..and they get your orders right.\n\nAll that aside, the food is what brought me here and I was not disappointed. I absolutely loved the vada sambar, in fact to this day I still think about that. It was very authentic. Since this place has so many different dosas to choose from, the owner recommended we try a bit of each! So we ordered about 4 dosas, and they cut it up for us so that we could have one piece of each dosa! That was simple but it went a long way in me giving a thumbs up to this place! \n\nThis place is the real deal, the best in Mississauga. The owner did mention that they are opening a new location, so if I were you, wait. Once the new location is open, then check this place out, I'm sure the overall experience will be better.", "name": "Steven"}, {"review_id": "r-Q8TGAx-0Lga-MPMTrgGu1g", "user_id": "u-J56C7Dc9E7Q0mpMTJGW6Qw", "date": "2011-10-23 02:58:31", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I came here tonight for a dinner as recommended by many of my Mississauga friends.

This restaurant felt like my favorite dosa chain in South India, through service and hospitality. \n\nThis location is tiny for the amount of customers they receive but they are moving soon to a larger location. On this visit we tried the bonda ($5, two small deep fried flour balls stuffed with spiced potatoes and served with coconut chutney). It was okay as I have had better. It seemed to be the same spiced potatoes they used in dosas and a little creativity would have served them better. \n\nWe also had the green chili masala dosa, spicy garlic masala dosa, and the ghee masala dosa(all $8-10 each). They were all excellently made and the dosas actually consisted of fresh chilies, garlic, and ghee, respectively. The chutneys and sambar were strong, flavorful, and very peppery as a nice change to the stale status quo of uninspired dosa restaurants in the GTA.

Walked around Victoria avenue and stumbled across Didar. I must say we were truly impressed. I haven't seen such an eclectic menu in an Indian restaurant in such a long time. We ordered a variety of dishes ( butter chicken, beef vindaloo, tandoori chicken, okra, lentils, shrimp masala, etc...) and none of the dishes disappoint. The flavours were incredible and on point. \n\nThe service was fantastic. It is a family run business and they do a great job in managing the night time rush. \n\nWe need to head back there shortly as there were so many dishes we wanted to taste.

I most often get the non Veg Thali (10$) with either Chicken curry or Butter chicken and either with Chana masala or lentils. I've tried many other dishes and have been amazed with the mix of flavour and spices. Some dishes that stick out to me is the Lamb vidaloo and the mango chicken. Both delicious.

Cheap and greasy. Tanjay, not bad but I'm not sure why it didn't impress me. Le Taj? Great but overpriced. Didar? Boom! The sweet spot. So overjoyed today for finally finding this Indian place where they managed to bring the best, most deliciously prepared succulent dishes accompanied with friendly, aim to please attitude and all for a reasonable and fair price. Ok ok, Yelp and Yelp friends helped me a lot of course discovering this truly hidden gem. All the credits go to them and I thank them for their honest and just reviews. Kudos. \n\nWe ordered Chana samosa, samosas, shrimp masala, lamb karahi, paneer saag, butter chicken, spinach, potatoes and chicken naan and rice. One is better than the next but got to say the lamb karahi was the star amongst today's choices. No funky smell or anything, fall off the bone tender juicy meat. Just amazing! A bit too much food for 4 where we got stuffed and had to ask to take the leftover home. When asked our spiciness level, we had to go between mild and medium. Not to my liking of course but had to be accommodating to the rest on the table. Sigh  \n\nThe place is not one of the best looking but it's clean, modest and has this authentic setting. Who cares about the looks? Once you start eating their super tasty food and the wine you brought with you, looks of the place won't matter. You're now indulged in gluttony ...Nothing else matters at this point my friend. Just dig in and enjoy the moment. \n\nI will most definitely come back and try the other goodies. This place is waaay up on my Indian resto list now. Number 1 for sure. Most likely will come alone at least once and ask them to make it extra spicy for me bcs my usual company are bunch of chicken with weak tolerance for spicy and hot food. I must've been an Indian in my previous life just bcs I love their food with their same tolerance level for spiciness.\nAn amazing find indeed.", "name": "Harry"}, {"review_id": "r-Ipd8f5ELfI2DZsTrHxfyuw", "user_id": "u-M52QrSGBxYao0zqzTZdntg", "date": "2017-11-29 21:08:00", "rating": 4.0, "text": "I visited Didar for dinner on a quiet Wednesday Evening.\nThere were a few group of people enjoying their dinner and a steady stream of take out orders coming in and out so it seemed like a good sign.\n\nWe ordered an entree of veggie pakora, Butter Chicken, Saag Lamb and a Chickpea Chana with two garlic naan bread.\n\nEverything was hot, fresh and very well seasoned.\n\nI will definitely be back to try other dishes!", "name": "Denis"}, {"review_id": "r-ESUZD85A_t-dVrSLAfeN3g", "user_id": "u-khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w", "date": "2018-11-28 01:45:47", "rating": 5.0, "text": "This place gets better every single time. \n\nI've been coming here for a while now and I can't get enough!

Most Uyghur are Muslim, so the food this restaurant serves is Halal. \n\nBesides their signature dish Dapanji, there are 2 more stuffs I would like to strongly encourage foodies to give a shot. One is the cumin-spiced lamb skewer. Another one is the \"Naan\" (made from flour). In general, none of the stuffs i have tried there so far disappointed me.

Given its location I knew I would have to set a side a good day to commute here if I wanted to reward my quest with a taste of the intriguing looking cuisine that was significant of to distinct Central Asian nation.\nBut my quest to go there was commenced sooner that I had planned when yesterday a dining companion keenly wanted to take a look when I mentioned it to him. And so we did just that.\n\nWe were both off to a funny start when we unexpectedly discovered that the restaurant caters to both Mandarin speaking and non-Mandarin speaking customers when we were given menus with Chinese scripts in them. We both had an amusing moment when trying to figure out what each dish was while also pretending to be academic linguists in the making by trying to decipher the Chinese description. Pretend-time was cut short when I decided to ask the waiter if English menus were available, he had a brief moment of embarrassment while going to get the respective menus.\nMost of the items are laid out across on a one page fold-out menu each accompanied with a picture depicting the described dish. \nThere are a few noodle dishes that looked similar to one another with the beds of noodles making the distinguishing the difference, a couple of soups and stews and the more familiar kebabs with the turkic style thicker naans. \n\nSo the two of us decided on getting the lamb kebab combo which comes with naan and an iceberg lettuce salad and also a langman noodle plate.\nThe kebabs came out first and having not had lamb in a while taste of the bite size pieces were dainty for me and even more so when wrapped in a piece of the naan bread. I hope that the owners start serving an Uyghur style salad at some point, it would make all the difference compared to the ice-berg salads that are served at other more distinct places.\nBut I definitely loved the noodles and what made it really good was the spiced-up gravy from the lamb curry that it was cooked in. I kept alternating between the noodles and spoonfuls of the hearty liquid. The flavor in the gravy reminded me of similar flavors found in some of the curry based noodle dishes in my country so it was really enjoyable to be able to taste something familiar from the langman dish. And if naan bread was also available as a side order I would have asked for one to soak up some of that gravy, yes delicious.\n\nAlot of the reviewers have mentioned the Dapanji so that what I'll have to try next time and maybe some of the other noodle dishes.", "name": "Eric"}, {"review_id": "r-LAi9Bz_KwOcm36IHhUcHKQ", "user_id": "u-OIM0gH6btoQv0IsEHdxajg", "date": "2013-04-20 18:53:55", "rating": 1.0, "text": "Worst restaurant ever !!!

They have the capacity to do two things very well - take out food and catering orders.While they have a couple of small tables where one may consume freshly made food this is not a sit down restaurant in the typical sense.\n.\nWhat is also useful to know is while the cuisine is Indian it has an East African influence and therefore there are some important differences to the usual Norther Indian restaurant food.So for example the samosas have a thinner crispy, triangular wrapping rather than the doughy, thick wrapping associated with Northern India.They also have fried Muhogo (cassava) that you do not find in Typical Indian cuisine. They make Biryani in two styles, the East African way with the rice and the masala gravy separate or the Lahori style where it is cooked and presented in one vessel.\n\nWe had the opportunity to sample various dishes during our two vists there to work out a catering menu for our event. The challenge was to accommodate the significant number of vegetarians among the majority carnivores. The management was very helpful in helping us come up with a good combination of items. My biggest problem was in trying to pick a few dishes as so many delightful items are available.\n\nI would highly recommend the Black Kebabs- fried meatballs essentially, with the right combination of spices. Bet you cannot just eat and stop at one.\nFor vegetarians they have the spicy potato balls (BatetaVada).\nWe had Chicken Pakoras that were a huge hit with our guests. The Chicken Biryani is a must.\n\nNext visit I want to try their masala fish- it looked so appetizing, but I truly was way too stuffed to try one more thing.\n\nOur order for 100 people was ready to be picked up at the appointed time.The portions were overly generous.The owners had gone out of their way to obtain disposable serving thalis for us, knowing we were out of town and the party was in a rented community center hall.\nI was impressed by the quality and quantity of food and the professionalism of the staff.", "name": "Al"}, {"review_id": "r-Zwo2SX7beAB6DssEemVwYA", "user_id": "u-MrSiwcX3gKm3kaXzgZq0pA", "date": "2012-10-09 02:21:38", "rating": 3.0, "text": "Pretty good, nothing special, but I like the place.

The key difference between my experiences at saffron and those of my own family, are merely the hands which prepared it. \n\nI can confidently say, after trying nearly every dish on their continuously rotating menu, that I have yet to have a single dish that was mediocre. They make a selection of their menu daily so as not to compromise their food quality by having several dishes sit. \n\nIf authenticity and uncompromising food quality is important to you, you should try out saffron. \n\nTheir aloo ghobi isn't just mashed potato and minced cauliflower like so many places seem to do. It has huge chunks of well cooked potato and cauliflower, which still has some consistency. Their Korma is actually not overbearing with the cashew paste, you can differentiate the constituent spices. Their veggie samosa is right on with seasoning and actually crisp. \nMy personal favorite has to be their Lamb vindaloo.\n\nTo which, you may ask them to make your order to your chosen spiciness level. \n\nTheir regular spice level would be mild-medium for the more adventurous. \n\nGive this family run establishment a try. I promise you that my tastes are very decerning. This establishment has more than exceeded my expectation everytime I have been. \n\nEven with all the good things going for them, their prices are the lowest average cost of any Indian takeout anywhere in the nw.

We started with the \"mix & match\" appy consisting of 2 samosas (we took beef), 3 kababs and 6 pakoras.  The samosas were ok, not the best but still very tasty.  The kababs were tasty but very dry.  But the pakoras were amazing!  Perfectly spiced and very crispy.  For entrees we went with butter chicken, chicken korma, dhaal makhani and veg curry and here's where I'm conflicted.  While everything tasted good, nothing tasted like what I'm used to.  I like my butter chicken to have a noticeable tomatoy taste but theirs was more rogan josh sauce.  The korma, again it tasted good, didn't have much of a coconut taste.  The dhaal makhana was quite good.  The curry veg were well spiced and good selection.  \n\nMy rating of 3/5 isn't completely fair in that the food & service were both good it just didn't have the tastes I've come to expect with EI food.", "name": "Kal"}, {"review_id": "r-iK6kdGYK0NC96eP0MT56hw", "user_id": "u-5dBKAgQE7F7CF-N6qRDkEQ", "date": "2012-11-04 01:32:09", "rating": 3.0, "text": "Saffron has me a bit torn.  \n\nOne hand it's solid food, served quickly, friendly staff, and reasonable prices for Indian in the NW side of town.  On the other,  if I'm craving Indian it doesn't quite satisfy. \n\nFrom someone who loves Indian food and had traveled to India and eaten the real deal - it's not quite to my quality of authentic.  For example,  the naan is closer to greek pita than I'd expect.  Not that I have an issue with greek pita... but just not always what I'm hoping for.  That being said, there isn't a lot of NW competition for Indian so it is sometimes better than taking a bit of a drive to something a little more authentic or going to a higher price point place that takes a while.  \n\nSaffron is a bit different that some restaurants in that they make a handful of dishes that day and you choose from those - not the menu unless you order in advance for a lot of people or something.   They will always have butter chicken and a dahl but other than that you'll have to call or just go check it out.   They will always have a few vegetarian dishes and then some with meat.  They often have ocra and saag which are far from my favourites - and that's sometimes a bit disappointing to me. \n\nThe good thing about Saffron is the food is made when you stop in (but does NOT taste like buffet style that's been sitting) so it's quick to stop in and pick up. \n\nThe prices for the NW are not bad.  For a veggie combo you get 1 veg dish, rice, naan and a curry for $9.  Add a buck for a meat combo.  Add a couple bucks for a second veg dish.  A combo with 1 dish is more than enough for me most of the time.   A combo with 2 dishes is usually 2 meals if I buy more naan.  Overall that's not a bad deal when facing the cost of other NW alternatives.\n\nOverall,  Saffron is definitely a good option to have around.\n\nReview 3 of 30 in Yelp's 30 Day Challenge", "name": "Cori"}]}, {"rest_id": "b-dg4EMyM1feTEWfLPSbunrg", "name": "Taj Indian Cuisine & Banquet Hall", "address": "6245 W Chandler Blvd, Ste 1", "postal_code": "85226", "city": "Chandler", "state": "AZ", "category": "Restaurants, Venues & Event Spaces, Buffets, Indian, Event Planning & Services", "country": "United States", "rating": 3.0, "photos": [], "reviews": [{"review_id": "r-pW2WszZCVJGPkzSEIM7rIA", "user_id": "u-hp6KQCEHBjENN1Q98oT0dg", "date": "2015-05-26 06:47:08", "rating": 3.0, "text": "I work near the place and wanted to try the lunch buffet.

(It may have taken me a few months to get her otherwise!) I was bouncing around the threads last night, saw \"Indian\" and got in the car. (I called on my way to make sure they were actually open.)\n\nFolks, this is easily the best Indian food I've found in Madison for three reasons:\n\n1. The Menu... holy cow, IT'S HUGE! I went for dinner and spent forever pouring over each and every page, looking up a few items on my phone because they were new to me. No shortage of variety here.   \n\n2. The Dosas... this and this alone should make you speed over. I think they have 15! That's nuts... NUTS! I'm used to seeing maybe 3 or 4 different kinds at a place.\n\n3. The Flavor... everything I tried was incredible. And although spice/heat is key to Indian cooking, theirs is well balanced, and not so hot that you can't taste anything. \n\nI had vegetable jalfrezi, chicken tikka masala, masala dosa and garlic naan. All of it was awesome! (GET THESE THINGS!) Even the garlic naan, which I sort of feel like is tough to make incredible, but it was incredible. It arrived at the table piping hot and aromatic and didn't have an offensive garlic flavor. The chicken tikka masala was some of the best I've had, topping some of the curry I long for in London. The veggies were tender yet crisp and in a super tasty sauce. And the dosa. Ohhhh the dosa. It was good, not my favorite, but with so many options, I can't wait to get back and try another one... maybe more adventurous than this one. \n\nHuge props to the stellar staff that made sure we had no questions about the menu, kept water glasses full, and told us they will have beer/wine/liquor soon. (Just wrapping up some paperwork.) They also sent us home with leftovers in boxes and gave us extra rice. Very kind. \n\nThe atmosphere ain't much, so don't go expecting to be transported to India or anything. There is some nice stuff hand painted on one wall, but that's about it. Small space. Bright light. No tunes playing the night I was there. I didn't notice construction dirt or dust so I'm guessing they cleaned up after what sounds like a rushed opening. And my feeling has always been, if I'm there the first week, I'm going to make a few exceptions anyway knowing they're still trying to find their footing. These guys have though.

And you don't make snide comments. \nAnd here's the kicker, we let it slide because there were other people in the store, and when we got home we realized we had gotten the WRONG order, we had 2 orders of bhajias.

I specifically ordered batata vada and even spelled it out because my pronunciation is terrible. They gave me the overpriced vada pau (which I can pronounce, and also, don't get that item because you're really only buying the bun.

I was having a little tough time explaining all the dishes to my boyfriend, but then the owner gave me a menu that explained most dishes for someone not familiar with Indian terms.\n\nJust like someone else said in their reviews, I was disappointed when I wasn't greeted or did not even get a smile. I tried to ease whatever tension was in the air by discussing some of the food items on the menu but it seemed like it was such a big task to get the lady to even talk to me.\nThat being said, the food still gets this place 5 stars and since it's a take out place, the lack of smiles doesn't bother me that much. Definitely a place to check out if you want to try something more than the usual South Indian or North Indian food.\n\nThe \"bataka vada\" (which should be 'batata' vada) was delicious! Even writing about it here is making me drool. My boyfriend had the paneer kathi rool and I had the Bombay grill sandwich, both of which were great. My masala chai was good too!\nSomething about the sev puri amused me though. They gave us whole puris, potatoes, noodles and sauces/chutneys separately and I had to make the puris (or mix it into the end product) myself when I got home. I see the reason why they did it, it is to keep the puris from going soggy with the sauces filled in them too long, but I doubt someone who is not familiar with Indian street food would understand what to do with a bunch of puffed up puris and sauces or how to make the sev puri.\n\nFYI, you need to tap one side of a puri to make a hole through which you put in just a bit of potatoes, mint chutney, tamarind sauce, yogurt and then top it with the sev (noodles) and eat the whole thing in one go! I hope this helps some confused soul out there in tasting this mouth-watering off-beat cuisine\n\nUpdate: Make sure the yogurt and chutneys are fresh before you take food home. I once got a bad batch where the yogurt had gone sour and the chutney container was puffed up with mold growing on the surface. Since it was too late to go back, I mentioned that to the owner the next time I went there, but they did not even so much as apologize for it. That did seem a little rude to me and so I had to knock off one star for service.", "name": "Maddie"}, {"review_id": "r-KV9-Ijzp0otQJZ896_CPXA", "user_id": "u-yfECTGBYb6IarwwNMm6zUA", "date": "2012-09-08 21:44:00", "rating": 5.0, "text": "This place is super DELISH!

A friend and I visited this place for a quick thali for lunch.  Price was on point at $6.99 for a thali with big helping of naan or two good sized whole wheat roti.  We also had rice, salad, Dahl, chick peas, eggplant dish, and yogurt, with a desert.  Well damn I was full and the food was super fresh and super good. Not too spicy but very flavourful and great quality! The cons: it was a single file line past a counter full of the sweets assortments but because you are kind of rushed past the sweets to the ordering spot it's hard to even think of making a thoughtful selection of the sweets to take home. The. You order and pay and are given a number. We weren't told what to do next so we kind of wandered around until someone yelled a number and we noticed someone else going to the buffet counter to pick their items.  The lady behind the food counter was rude and rushed like a drill sergeant.  When we were called up we ordered and basically we're shouted one word commands from the lady. \"Veg, sweet, next, naan!?\"  It was weird. Then we sat with our food and without our breads and waited. They gave the naan but not the roti and we had to ask the rude lady for the roti. So, be ready to order and be shuffled. The food was really good because I forgot about the feeling of basic training after I stuffed myself with their great feast of a thali!!", "name": "Vanessa"}, {"review_id": "r-GnvrfCeXNE4vjgQGx8qRWg", "user_id": "u-CNSxXqTose2P5Lf_MMXfDw", "date": "2019-09-01 02:35:54", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Great place for a quick bite.

We have been at this restaurant several times. This is a self serve restaurant. You stand in a line to place your order, get a table, pick up disposable cutlery, foam glass and a water jug, and wait for your number to be called when your food item is ready. \n\nPrices at the self serve restaurants are usually less when compared with other restaurants with full service. You can get Thali for $6.49 which consists of 3 veggies, a dessert, salad, rice and a nan bread or two rotis (whole wheat bread). It's a decent price and food tastes okay.\n\nHowever today July 16, 2015 we had made a visit to this restaurant with two other families for a quick meal. In my order I had found a plastic stripe in rice which was about 6-7cm long (pictures have been posted in the picture gallery section). While chewing my food I felts something wasn't right and when I took the stuff out of my mouth that is when I found this plastic stripe. I was disgusted and so as others on the table. Imagine how unhealthy and unhygienic it Paul's have been if I would have digested that plastic.\n\nSad part is when I showed the plastic found in my food to the girls at the front they called the one of their senior girl who just said it could have been from their plastic bags outside and said she could give me extra rice if I want. She didn't even apologize. I declined her offer of free rice and said thank you to her. \n\nAt that point 6 people on the table had lost their appetite and we decided to leave the place. All 6 of them, regular customers of this restaurant, said they will never visit this unhygienic restaurant again. \n\nI really hope they take the cleanliness and hygiene seriously.", "name": "Sunny"}, {"review_id": "r-sOEfpBri-czYY0L4BYhZzg", "user_id": "u-nNjaWd2seeh5pbAj5GFbRQ", "date": "2015-05-25 16:45:43", "rating": 1.0, "text": "As many have said, the service is worst.

There is no dahi (yogurt) to start off with like at other Indian restaurants. They put the salad, onions, and cucumbers under the rice which makes no sense. The naan came way later and the mango shakes by the time we were done our meal. No one informed us that they were ready, we had to go about four times ourselves. The staff doesn't even ask or care. The naans were mostly very crisp and oily, not appealing at all. Most were burnt. The channa had no spices, lacking severe taste. The mango SHAKE was garbage, it was just mango juice. \n\nThe staff doesn't even ask if you need anything else. There were unprofessional foam cups in the corner with some open straws for people to take if they were dining in. Again, had to ask and find them.

William has a great Vegetarian and Non Vegetarian lunch special, perfectly delicious and at a great price. We come here once a week for our Indian treat! This particular visit instead of the lunch special I wanted to have the Chicken curry again. However I wanted the authentic Indian version, not the Westernized cubed chicken breast version. See I grew up true Indian food with close family Indian friends and have come to love a true authentic Chicken curry made with Chicken pieces chopped up with a clever, chicken skin, bones and all. I asked William the owner chef if he could make the chicken curry this way for me, surprised by my request he said that's how they have it at home and that's the true way to prepare it, however to make it more commercially acceptable they make it it with chicken breast cubed in the restaurant. William was more than happy to prepare the meal for me the authentic way and got right to it, and by the looks of it, happy to accommodate my request, even down to the spice level I required. While William was whipping up my special request we started with a truly delicious hot and spicy crispy crunchy flaky Samosa filled with a curry potato and pea filling appetizer served with a delicious mint sauce and tamarin sauce. James had the non vegetarian lunch special, Chicken Tikka Masala & Chicken  Korma served with rice. William brought out my chicken curry and it was absolutely superb! The authentic way with chopped chicken pieces has so much more flavor! I enjoyed it so much! Taking me back to my aunty Priscilla's chicken table 20 years back.

Our food took almost 30 min to get to the table. #2 even though the Marsala tasted pretty good, the portion was so small & there was literally 8 chopped up pieces of chicken in the 16 oz bowl which we paid 16 bucks for. #3 we ordered the paradise special platter that had 5 little ass pieces of different types of chicken, a little piece of fish , 2 quarter sized pieces of lamb, & 2 nickel sized shrimps, which we paid 25 bucks for. None of which had any flavor but we managed to eat it because we dipped everything in the Marsala sauce while we forced ourselves to eat. #4 we ordered saffron rice which is suppose to be more flavorful but it literally tasted like salty rice. 6 bucks for that.

The servers are nice, and the place is always clean and well kept. My only suggestion for them would be to check in patron's drink status frequently.

I love naan bead, so I chose to be adventurous and had the garlic naan. The garlic naan was hot, fresh, and delicious. Now to the buffet of foods. They serve the most distinguished dishes for their patrons to divulge in: chicken curry, chicken tandori, chicken, and goat marsala (my favorite, the goat was not hard or chewy, but fall of the bone tender). \n\nAlso to add they serve mango lassi for a perfect touch to your meals. I wish they had better servings or variety of desserts as they only had rice pudding and fruits to consume. I had to ask for the gulab jamun, which the owner son was friendly enough to give.

When I asked how much time it was going to take if I were to order butter chicken (14$) and naan bread (2$), he paused and thought for a while, and then answered, \"It's going to take at least 30 minutes\" as if to dissuade me from ordering.

The staff was very accommodating and offered us a proposal that wasn't already present on the menu, since it seemed that many of us simply couldn't decide what we'd like from the plethora of delicious sounding options on the menu. \n\nAs someone who enjoys sampling a wide variety of dishes, their solution to this plight seemed perfect. The came out with such a wide variety of things to try. Crisp and plump samosas, savoury onion bhadgi, tender chicken tikka, steaming and tart mixed veg, steaming basmati, AMAZING naan, still sizzling chicken tikka masala, and let's not forget creamy butter chicken, among other things. The server was even kind enough to dish out the sizzling hot chicken tikka masala himself to avoid having us pass around a really hot dish (thus avoiding a potential disaster :p).\n\nThe thing that really got me though was when I spotted chicken dopiaza on the menu (something I find so rarely in Indian restaurants!). Upon mentioning my excitement, the kind server promised he would work it into the mix. It did not disappoint. If you're an onion fan, don't miss their chicken dopiaza! \n\nAll in all, wonderful service, magnificent food (didn't have a single thing I didn't love!) and would definitely visit again.

We ordered a Manchurian Beef Noodle ($8) for take out.  It filled 2 boxes.  My BF and I could only finish 1 of the 2 boxes together.\n\n2) Price - Very affordable.  $8 for a Manchurian Beef/Chicken Noodle.  $9 for a Chicken Pakora.  There were about 15 pieces of pakora (see picture).  Each piece was the size of a golf ball.  Lunch special is $6 per item, available Monday to Friday.\n\n3) Services - The waitress was fast, effective and friendly.  She gave us extra napkins per request.  Like 4 extra thick napkins.  It was pretty generous.  \n\n4) Cleanliness - the exterior of the store looked divey.  The interior looked nothing special.  The washroom (ladies) was, surprise surprise, very clean and tidy.  Yes, the bathroom amenities were no frills and basic, but it was CLEAN as in no dust, no spot or mark, no mess on floor.  I won't say completely dust free, but it beat the cleanliness level of many expensive restaurants.  And there was hot water, hand soap, paper towels.  I was impressed.  Someone cared about washroom here.\n\n5) Food - I am no authority of Indian Chinese food.  Did the food taste the way it was supposed to taste like?  No clue.  I could tell you everything tasted bold. There were strong spices flavours.  The pakoras were delicious.  The noodle was average: mostly noodle, little beef, orange in colour.  The noodle was noted as non-spicy on menu.  It was actually mildly spicy.  Food was made to order.  It came out of kitchen piping hot.  \n\nThe food rating is 3 stars in truth.

Chock-full of veggies, tofu and chicken.\n- Chicken Pakora - crispy and flavorful on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.\n- Chili Fish (dry) lunch special which comes with a tiny egg roll (bleh), rice and soup/pop.

The prices were very reasonable for the ice cream and scoops are quite generous. \n\nI sampled a few flavors (Saffron pistachio, sapota fruit, ginger) before deciding on the ginger, single scoop. All the samples overall had good flavor but had a grainy texture to them. I enjoyed the spicy kick of ginger flavor and it was a perfect sweetness.

The dessert (vermicelli kheer) tasted like plain milk with some noodles thrown in, and the jalebi was quite soggy. We were the only people there and noticed that they closed up right after we left (though it was just after 5:30 PM), so maybe they were just having an off day.

Add to the mix the trippy Ganesha cartoon being projected on the window, and you're definitely half way to Manhattan. \n\nIt's a cool sensation, and perhaps one that can only be experienced at a later evening hour.

The average entree is $12. \n\nWe had Baigan Bartha, Paneer Makhani and Dal Makhani. We requested a medium spice, and it was on the lower edge of spicy. Of the three dishes, the Paneer was the absolute best, the perfect balance of tomato and cream and without a trace of grease. They definitely pride themselves on cooking fresh and healthy. I would not order the dal again. It is usually my favorite Indian dish, but this is the second time I have had it here. Both times I have walked away thinking it tasted like a not so great chili. However, the baigan was solid.

We went here looking at the reviews and were disappointed. Don't get me wrong, if you're new to Indian food (like many reviewers here seem to be) you'll probably like it. Unfortunately for Samosa Fake-tory, we've had our share of good Indian food and Samosa Factory isn't it.\n\nFirst off, to the uninitiated, samosas look and taste nothing like the one's you find here. I mean, not even close! Google samosas and you will see what they look like. After our samosas, we ordered the thalis (sort of an Indian mixed plate) and the naan (fluffy, delicious Indian bread) was great. I didn't like the saag (mustard leaf) but my SO did. Neither of us liked the chicken curry or the potatoes and cauliflower. Contrary to popular claim, the rice wasn't basmati. You can't ever go wrong with mango lassi (mango flavored yogurt drink) and that probably was the best part of our meal. In summary, our food was okay but the alien samosa was a massive FAIL.

I can't believe they serve the food they serve and still stay open! We visited the campus location, while taking a break from our road trip and were famished when we got here. It was thanksgiving day, so not much open and very few people inside. \nFirst of all, I'm confused about whether this place is self service or not. Someone greeted us at the door and seated us, gave us menus. To place an order, you have to walk up to the counter. They bring the dishes to you. You need to grab your own utensils. They expect you to place dirty dishes in a far corner yourself. Just extremely confusing and annoying. I have nothing against self service - in fact it's awesome and efficient, but this weird process made no sense.\n\nAnyways - the food. We started wit the mango chat. It was made with old papris and was over over sauced. I would be okay with that - if th sauce tasted good. It did not - way too much heeng and terrible flavor.\n\nLily wanted to paneer 65 - it tasted of nothing, had a weird red color and the texture of rubber. We actually were not able to get through more than 3 pieces collectively. She also had the garlic naan. I think you should be punished for screwing up something as simple as garlic naan and they totally didn't - too much garlic and uncooked sides, ugh.\n\nI had the gobhi parantha and again - how you screw up something so simple, I don't understand. It was uncooked in placed and I could taste the raw dough. The filling tasted of nothing and there wasn't  enough of it. It was also slathered with way too much oil/ butter \n\nRags loves chicken - he didn't like their version of chicken tikka. Everything tasted stale and disgusting.
