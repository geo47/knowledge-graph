Even though Silver Spoon have expanded to another location in Scarborough  so that there are now two Silver Spoons the Pickering location has managed to maintain consistent quality  although consistent quality can vary on days. Well  what restaurant does not  have that problem You might be suddenly short - staffed  someone down with the flu   or perhaps one of your deliveries did not  make it on time It is good food. Katya prefer the Pakistani cuisine :  Nihari Haleem not always available  and several of the biryanis. Silver Spoon are now offering Sindhi Biryani on weekends  and Katya m so pleased ! The only way that Katya could get Sindhi Biryani in the past was to make Sindhi Biryani Katya using a packaged spice blend. If you want to get Naan  Katya recommend the Butter Naan. Although the Butter Naan costs a bit more the butter enhancements really take Naan to the next level of browning and savoury tastes. Ok  things sit under the heat lamp but things do not seem to suffer that much  particularly something like Nihari  which is a stew - type dish that can withstand the warming table. Everything has always tasted fresh when Katya have ordered it. Katya find that the samosas are fairly standard  but there are other appetizers which are more exciting. For people who like the dark meat of the chicken Lollypop Chicken is great and consistently good. Katya also enjoy Shami Kabab. If you like fish  do not  skip the Fingerfish  which is consistently tasty. Whenever Katya have been there  which is perhaps once a month or two  for the past five years the portions have been generous. Katya am certainly a fan  and Silver Spoon fills an important niche in the local  Pickering community as a convenient place to pick up some Halal take - away of decent quality.", "name": "Katya"}, {"review_id": "r-NLaGpX4hCMraZ9OukN0AnQ", "user_id": "u-Uaqawx2iD0mT5YP_akJrJw", "date": "2014-06-27 00:28:47", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Oh  Silver Spoon. Heli have  tried to love Silver Spoon. Heli have  given Silver Spoon so many chances. But this just is not  working out anymore. To start :  the food is not  exactly terrible. the food just...not very good. Heli have  tried almost every meat dish  the chana masala  samosas  biriyanis  etc. Indian take - out is hardly known for Indian take - out's healthiness but when you order a veal karahi and get two sad chunks of meat floating in half a container in oil it is  a little disheartening. Add to that the fact that food is often sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long... On the upside :  the chicken biriyani is good bang for your buck  -  especially during the week when the chicken biriyani is  on special. You get a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat. a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat  ready to go so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for your order. There was that one time they ran out of chicken biriyani  which is understandable when the chicken biriyani is  on special  but then offered me a  regular biriyani read : JUST rice  for the same price. Ummm  say what   Heli do love their beef samosas -  it is  just to bad that they NEVER HAVE ANY. Seriously  Heli have been here early in the evening  at random times during the week  and they have loads of sad looking veggie samosas  but no beef. Heli feel like the owners need to do a serious evaluation of what works and does not  work. If you notice you are  always selling out of a certain item  and NOT another   does not  it make sense to up a certain item while downsizing another Who knows. My biggest gripe was the chana masala incident. The last time Heli went in  Heli ordered a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about  but my husband likes . The girl at the counter kind of made a face and said Oh... no. Heli do not  want a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes. Heli was confused. There was a whole tray of a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes there  brimming with chick - pea goodness. a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes not... good today. What What does that mean  Is the taste just  off  or had a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes spoiled  In either event why is there a full tray of  not good  chana masala here for customers to look at  and possible walk out the door with   Heli stared at a full tray of  not good  chana masala  and The girl at the counter motioned at a full tray of  not good  chana masala again Heli was just going to remove a full tray of  not good  chana masala from here anyway. But  um  Heli did not . And Heli was the only person in the store. From the wide glass window  before Heli even stepped in  Heli could see that there was no one else even there. She had not  even come over until Heli would  been standing there for a few minutes. It really bothers me that Heli still really do not  know what was so wrong with an entire tray of food that an entire tray of food would warrant being thrown out  -  and why an entire tray of food HADN T been thrown out immediately if an entire tray of food really could not  be saved. It was clear from the crispiness on the top you know that kind of layer of  kin  that develops   that an entire tray of food had been sitting for a while. Ultimately  Heli m really quite relieved the staff person told me before Heli bought a full tray of  not good  chana masala took a full tray of  not good  chana masala home and got diarrhea or something this would be a much harsher review if that had happened... And Heli guess that says something positive about the customer service  sorta... As more and more Indian food places -  both takeout and dine - in  -  emerge in the region  store owners need to realize that customers are going to eventually become more discerning. Heli really wanted this place to be a favorite  -  after all  this place is  very convenient for me  -  but  sorry Silver Spoon Silver Spoon just do not  make the cut.", "name": "Heli"}, {"review_id": "r-ZAmkMWTSbWQRO-uEzYmR8g", "user_id": "u-pj7M1RIWV0caCp7Kj91JxA", "date": "2014-12-17 03:39:34", "rating": 3.0, "text": "Silver Spoon do not have lots of crowd and it taste is different than other locations.

Canadian Tire Home Depot are your neighbours why do not  you just buy some fans and write some fans off as a business expense Owners this is not a good look ! Aside from that  there was still a line - up of post -   -  ers coming in to grab some grub for their hungry families. A female customer ahead of Stephanie what telling worker which pieces of mutton to grab  -  without the bone. Makes sense  as you do not  really want a container full of bone  +  sauce for dinner. A female customer ahead of me was being soo demanding  yet worker did not  flinch one bit. That was pretty impressive as Stephanie would have  exploding  especially with the heat ! Stephanie got a Chicken Biryani to - go    . maybe   -   pieces of chicken  pretty good flavour -  can not  complain for price    a Matar Paneer    . for a large  not enough paneer  mostly peas   gravy . Perhaps Stephanie should have taken note from A female customer ahead of me and directed worker to scoop up more pieces of paneer ! Whatever the case maybe  both dishes were more than acceptable to Stephanie. Along with the questionable management  re : no - AC the food handling is somewhat suspect as well.

Pierre have to say Pierre have  definitely had better Indian food for some reason the taste does seen rather bland for authentic Indian cuisine Pierre think the chiefs play it safe with the level of spice. Most dishes are delicious it just seems like something is missing for authentic Indian cuisine to be considered real great Indian cuisine. Pierre do not know enough about how to cook Indian food to say exactly what it is. Pierre like the fact that the dishes are not salty  the only time Pierre feel bad from the food is when Pierre eat to much. The tandoori although good seems a little short on flavor  small pieces the butter chicken is quite disappointing the butter chicken is very rich and does not  taste  like butter chicken Pierre remember from other restaurants  not to mention the butter chicken has bones in the butter chicken what a sin. There always seems to be more sauce than chicken. The pieces Pierre thought were quite small. The beef dish is good  the curry goat and chicken not so much the meat on these dishes seems very tough Pierre think Bombay Buffet use the cheapest meat for Bombay Buffet. Pierre have not   tried the dishes on the menu yet bet Pierre assume the dishes on the menu are allot better. The veggie dishes seem old like The veggie dishes have  been sitting The veggie dishes's for days overall Bombay Buffet does not seem to heat the food Pierre have never seen the food really hot there not cold just lukewarm. The only hot item is when Bombay Buffet bring the Nan bread from the oven. Pierre really wish Bombay Buffet had more of those famous  Indian deserts  instead of ice cream which Pierre do not  think is sanitary to leave ice cream there and everybody dig in to ice cream and they need to cover ice cream separately as well not just the door. The service unfortunately is not that great either the owner is very friendly however the waiters seem disengaged like the waiters just want to go home no small talk no smile nothing. The worst thing for m about being served in a restaurant is when Pierre have to ask for EVERYTHING Pierre do not  mind sometimes but Pierre always have to ask for another drink  more water napkins remove bottles etc. every single time. Bombay Buffet does give the appearance of being clean especially the washrooms which is one of the reasons Pierre go back. Pierre must say Pierre have seen attitude from some of the staff again not the owner. On one occasion a girl working there who Pierre never seen  before or ever since actually spoke rather rudely to Pierre in an unfriendly tone for putting a little sauce back on the buffet dish from Pierre's plate OMG Call the police lol. Last thing Pierre want to address is the decor definitely needs an upgrade seating could be set up better to maximize space the carpet looks old and decrepit and the T.V looks nice but Pierre have  never seen the T.V on. Pierre do not  think they want to pay for cable and no clock whats up with that oh Pierre get it do not  let people know what time it is so people wo not  leave to soon or have another beverage. The thing Pierre hate about the buffet section is there is no light Pierre think it should be the other way around lots of light to see Bombay Buffet and less light in the dinning room perhaps candles would make for a better dinning experience  flowers would create ambience sometimes the music is too loud for dinning. Pierre think rather than everybody so close to each other in the dinning room they should use the other room as well especially on the weekends where seating is an issue. One more thing  through the week business is petty slow sometimes only Pierre and a few people are there. So why play games with the few customers you have  one time a waiter who is no longer there charged Pierre imported price for domestic beer Pierre brought domestic beer to the owner  attention and the owner adjusted the bill the next time Pierre went no apologies were given everybody know Budweiser is domestic duh. Another time Pierre specifically asked for a Canada Dry Ginger Ale and a Canada Dry Ginger Ale is  the name a Canada Dry Ginger Ale is listed as on the menu the owner brings a Canada Dry Ginger Ale to Pierre and life is good. The next one Pierre ordered the owner brings no name ginger ale Pierre was so angry Pierre just left as soon as Pierre finished the meal Pierre did not  want to lose it. Ant the no name of course tastes like crap tastes is  why no name ginger ale's cheap but the owner still charged Pierre the   . . One time the said waiter who is no longer there when Pierre asked the said waiter who is no longer there when Pierre asked him to remove the bottles from the table to remove the bottles from the table the owner said Pierre have a big table with lots of room. What the hell is the owner talking to Pierre like that for. Unbelievable this is not how you talk to customers who pay your bills. As you can imagine it was reflected in the tip. Another time they tried to give Pierre a bottle of beer that was opened for days flat as hell they corrected that when Pierre  spoke up about a bottle of beer that was opened for days flat as hell. Look Pierre m not saying to avoid Bombay Buffet at all  Pierre just know they could make it a whole lot better. Pierre usually go alone and Pierre have  noticed the more people the better the service. the  bigger the tip By all means check it out Bombay Buffet used to be    . they just raised it to    . but the Bombay Buffet items did not change at all  nothing new added go figure.", "name": "Pierre"}, {"review_id": "r-bA9_SyRS3Z3h5IgMpEgt-A", "user_id": "u-rlqSOqnC4IDP612W2DlYLw", "date": "2013-11-26 19:34:31", "rating": 1.0, "text": "Went there for a Sunday lunch party.

Suvi went to grab food and the plates were not   that clean once Suvi found a clean plate. Suvi realized how limited  the food was and there  was hardly any veggie options the meat did not   taste great either. the food was cold and dry  not not appealing at all. To be honest the butter chicken  Suvi love having and Bombay Buffet Indian Cuisine butter chicken was horrible the can of  butter chicken sauce  at NoFrills taste better then what NoFrills had. The cart with the food  was not  even full. Once Suvi ate food  Suvi had to use the same plate to get food again if Suvi wanted seconds. Suvi got free naan at Suvi's table and  the tv in Bombay Buffet Indian Cuisine had black glare so Suvi could not  really enjoy the tv in the restaurant and they turned the tv in the restaurant off half way. The dessert was limited to ice cream which was almost empty  rice pudding and gulabjam  which was not  that sweet. The waiters almost rushed Suvi out by grabbing Suvi's plates once  Suvi were done like The waiters did not  want Suvi to sit and enjoy each others company. Suvi would not  recommend Bombay Buffet Indian Cuisine as a buffet for  huge family dinner Suvi rather go to Mandarin even though Mandarin's pricier.", "name": "Suvi"}, {"review_id": "r-9ZBAPCv1oHvaPdcZzuzLUg", "user_id": "u-6ymZbkJ7vt8eGHA7bHlONg", "date": "2011-03-13 03:14:52", "rating": 1.0, "text": "the buffet was the worst indian food Amanda have ever had to date.

After checking out the buffet  Amanda opted to have butter chicken off the menu  hoping that butter chicken at least would be hot and fresh. When butter chicken arrived  butter chicken was hot  but the cuts of meat were terrible. It did not  seem like it was the chicken breast that the menu promised it would be. Amanda picked at butter chicken  and hardly ate butter chicken. Meanwhile  Amanda's family was waiting for the buffet to refill the buffet. It seemed like the buffet brought one item out every    minutes  even though the buffet was empty. The naan took the longest to restock  and The naan always seems flat and cold when The naan got there. Amanda was smart  and ordered The naan from the menu so when The naan came The naan was at least fresh.

Michael have never seen that done before. Anyway  the three of us ordered a bunch of different dishes and enjoyed sharing the flavors and food items. Michael think Michael's favorite was the GOBI     which was fried cauliflower. the GOBI     which was fried cauliflower was magnificently prepared with the best spices. the GOBI     which was fried cauliflower was preceded by paneer  which is an Indian cheese  cut into square pieces and served with onions and peppers. Michael also ordered one of the curry dishes and a Ravaa Dosa  which was served with chutney and lentil soup. a Ravaa Dosa  which was served with chutney and lentil soup was served flat on the plate  as opposed to the rolled up dosas that Michael have had in the past. Finally  Michael shared some cheese bread. Michael can not  say enough greats things about the quality of the food and the flavors. There were two things that Michael thought could have been better. The dishes could have been served a little warmer than what The dishes were. The second thing is that the service was painfully slow. It took at least    minutes for our first dish to be served. And the service stayed slow  all the way til the end of our meal. Perhaps they are undergoing start up pains or perhaps they were understaffed tonight. No sure. What Michael will remember is the how Michael's palette jumped up and down with each bite. There is a bar in Red Chillez  but the emphasis seems to be on beer and wine.

In addition to their Dosa Buffet  there are Dosa menus on the tables for you to basically order bottomless  made - to - order Dosas. And bottomless  made - to - order Dosas are  ALL delicious.

Tangra Villa's chili dishes  mango dishes sweet and spicy  sweet and sour dishes are heavily marinated with sauces and stir - fried onions. If you are looking for something dry however  Monica highly recommend the Tangra Villa Meat dishes. To say Tangra Villa is flavourful is an understatement. With every bite Monica can taste the garlic  the spices  the onions  and the parsley used in the seasoning.

Demi have been a regular at Maharaja for years but Demi might now be an even bigger fan of Haveli Restaurant. the lunch buffet has a lot of great offerings. Though the space around the lunch buffet is crowded and could be opened up more the buffet items were delicious. Demi had an amazing eggplant dish the Tikki masala was so good  even better than Maharajas  and Haveli Restaurant give you a choice of regular Nan or coconut Nan. coconut Nan is out of this world ! Haveli Restaurant's tandoori chicken was nice and tender and not too dry  also an excellent dish. Demi also tried Haveli Restaurant's rice pudding and Mango Lassi which were both excellent. Demi think being a newer restaurant there are a couple of kinks to be ironed out like making sure the lunch buffet has enough plates and bowls available. The staff was friendly which Demi appreciated. Haveli Restaurant upped Haveli Restaurant's buffet prices on the weekend which Demi think was not Haveli Restaurant's best move and not only is Haveli Restaurant more affordable but Demi think has better food overall.

But the service today was REALLY BAD ! A coworker of Lia ordered a chicken wrap Lia know for a fact that A coworker of mine ordered chicken since A coworker of mine was young A coworker of mine never ate BEEF because of A coworker of mine's religion so there is no way in hell that A coworker of mine will ever order BEEF. So A coworker of mine got A coworker of mine's wrap and A coworker of mine started eating a chicken wrap. Since its a wrap unless you disassemble a chicken wrap you would not know by the looks of a chicken wrap whether it was red or white meat inside so A coworker of mine took a bite and ate a chicken wrap. Never in A coworker of mine's life A coworker of mine tasted beef so A coworker of mine ask us taste a chicken wrap since a chicken wrap tasted weird for A coworker of mine. So Lia disassembled a chicken wrap at this point and tasted the meat inside a chicken wrap. the meat inside it was beef !  !  !  !  ! At that point Lia's coworker talked to the cashier and informed the cashier that instead of giving A coworker of mine's chicken  A coworker of mine gave A coworker of mine's beef. Instead of apologizing  Lia raised Lia's voice to Lia's coworker and told A coworker of mine A coworker of mine made a mistake on A coworker of mine's order which was not true at all. Unfortunately  Lia do not  have a proof since the receipt just says lunch special. Lia did not apologized   Lia did not even offer to give A coworker of mine a replacement. At this point Lia's coworker even though clearly upset but hungry  ordered another chicken wrap despite us telling A coworker of mine not to do it and Lia can just transfer to another restaurant. Lia was well tempted to just really make a scene but Lia do not  want to stoop down to Lia's level. The   of us and all other people that Lia know of swear never again to go back to Afghan Cuisine ! Lia understand that the reason that the cashier would have not  admitted the cashier's mistake was that it might end up that the cashier foot the bill. But what Lia do not  understand is why Lia needs to raise Lia's voice to Lia's coworker. A simple hint of humility could have been ok.

Malinda have  lived all over India  and have had Indian enough to know ...  good from great . Soma Grill is truly  great  food. Malinda have  been to Soma Grill with my husband over a dozen times and Malinda will  keep coming back. Why  you ask Well  the answer is simple. The food is hand made every day  the staff is full of heart and spirt  and the owner is a wonderful woman who truly cares about the owner's guests. Here  some things Malinda would  like to brag about eating there : Start with the :  Vegetable Samosa   comes with an order of two and two dipping sauces   -  these triangular delights are a perfect way to start your meal. The green dipping sauce is perfectly spicy and compliments the brown sweet dipping sauce. YUM ! ! ! For dinner Malinda share. Here  what Malinda love there ... but first  you must know dinner comes with a cup of mildly spicy and delicious lentil soup  as well as a fresh salad. a fresh salad has a zesty yogurt dressing lightly garnishing the top of a fresh salad. Now for the main course. Chicken Tikka Masala  Chicken Tikka Masala comes in a light red orange cream sauce  Chicken Tikka Masala is tender and a light red orange cream sauce has a bold rich tomato flavor. Mmmmm ... Get the Naan to dip in a light red orange cream sauce so no drop goes to waste. Lamb Kashmiri  Lamb Kashmiri has a mild burgandy sauce with almonds in Lamb Kashmiri Lamb Kashmiri tastes like Lamb Kashmiri has been cooking all day. If you have  ever had  osso bucco  from an Italian restaurant ... you know osso bucco  from an Italian restaurant. Lamb Kashmiri is as tender as osso bucco  from an Italian restaurant. AND a mild burgandy sauce with almonds in it  a mild burgandy sauce with almonds in it has a ton of flavor. If you eat lamb lamb is something you must try. Fish Cod  Madras this dish is perfectly cooked white fish in a very fresh rich colored tomato sauce with onions and mushrooms What Malinda really like about this dish is how much this dish complements the heavier flavors in a light red orange cream sauce. If you are  looking for a vegetable dish my husband and Malinda have tried a few of a vegetable dish. my husband and Malinda's favorite is the  Aloo Gobi    Aloo Gobi the  Aloo Gobi has potato  and cauliflower mixed in a light  fresh crushed tomato sauce the  Aloo Gobi  very good and a nice compliment to all the meat dishes Malinda order  to share. Malinda have  had both the garlic and regular naan. both the garlic and regular naan are  perfect for dipping  and in my opinion naan is a  must have  when eating an Indian meal. Rice comes with the meals so if you do not  want bread but want a starch you will  be happy to know white rice accompanies all entrees. As for dessert Malinda have  had the rice pudding and pistachio ice - cream this is the kulfi  on the menu. Between those two  Malinda would  pick the pistachio ice - cream every time. the pistachio ice - cream very refreshing after a hot meal. Also  each time Malinda visit Malinda always get the hot chai tea. the hot chai tea is made to order and is worth the wait. You add the sugar which puts you in the drivers seat  as far as sweetness goes. Malinda recommend Soma Grill to anyone looking to try something other than a chain restaurant. Soma Grill is worth a try and if you already like Indian food take Malinda's dinner suggestions. You wo not  be sorry !

Eva's favourite is definitely Tandoori Kabob. The chicken was juicy and flavourful  with a bit of a kick. The chicken breast is good if you are not  looking for something spicy. As for Chaplee Kabob it was Eva's first time trying Chaplee Kabob. Eva liked the marinade and the meat was cooked perfectly  but the meat was quite oily... The salad is always fresh and Eva love the Afghani bread  especially dipped in both the sauces . For about    more you can get a dinner platter which comes with quite a bit of basmati rice. Watan Kabob has a fairly straightforward ordering system. You just have to order and pay at the counter then wait until your number is called. Watan Kabob can be quite busy  even on a weeknight  packed with families and children playing hide - and - seek behind you. Watan Kabob is very similar to Bamiyan Kabob  Eva read in an earlier review that the owner of Watan Kabob used to work there . However  Watan Kabob differs from a restaurant with waiter service  an extensive menu  and more comfortable seating  like Paramount.

Sujith went for the weekend buffet and there were tons of items. Sujith was pretty pleased Hyderabad House Arizona had many more veg items compared to   non - veg dishes. Sujith the never seen a veg biriyani being part of buffet. a veg biriyani was always chicken biriyani. So Sujith's non - veg friends were not too pleased with this. my non - veg friends had a paneer pulao so Sujith would suggest to replace a paneer pulao with a non - veg rice item. For Sujith the highlight was Aloo Bonda and the fried baby corn. Sujith cannot finish this review without mentioning the awesome Sambar. the awesome Sambar is hands down the best in the valley. Sujith had Sambar with uttapam and also with rice. The last time Sujith had Sambar with rice was at bheemas in CA so this was worth it. the weekend buffet runs at   . which is a little bit on the expensive side.

However  Hello immediately had a sinking feeling when Hello entered Armaan Taste of India and noticed that Armaan Taste of India was empty. Completely silent ! In fact  there was not even a worker or owner present until my uncle whistled  prompting the owner to rush towards us and seated us. After the owner seated us  Hello waited a few minutes  and when water did not  show Hello felt annoyed that Hello had to ask for water. Armaan Taste of India  a restaurant  Jesus Christ  ! In addition  Hello noticed the lack of papadum and the various chutneys Hello was familiar with receiving at every Indian restaurant Hello had ever been too. However  Hello forgave this as maybe things are not the same in Las Vegas as Los Angeles. On the topic of service  every single item Hello ordered took absurdly long to prepare  considering Hello were the ONLY customers present. In fact  one of my uncles had specially ordered a Chana masala without onion and garlic because one of my uncles does not  eat onion and garlic. a Chana masala without onion and garlic did not  even show up until the rest of us had almost finished eating. Service aside  let  move on to the most important part :  quality of food. The vegetable Pakora  the first appetizer  was literally a cauliflower fried in unseasoned batter which was disgusting. Hell  anyone could make better pakoras than what was prepared by Armaan Taste of India. On some pieces  Hello could see the raw cauliflower which had none of unseasoned batter. Unappetizing much  Hello decided to clear my mind; perhaps the main dishes would be somewhat decent. Oh boy  was Hello wrong ! The paneer tikka masala tasted like someone had dumped heaps of tomato paste  tomato pur e  and chunks of tomato  with sugar and small sprinkles of Indian spices. This was despite my request for extremely spicy paneer tikka masala. The malai kofta gravy tasted like raw sewage diluted with turmeric and chilly power. By far  the most disgusting dish. The channa masala which my uncle had ordered looked like little shit pieces in brown gravy. The next morning  my uncle said one of my uncles threw up all of the disgusting channa masala. Hello presume the high ratings are from non - Indians who do not  know how delicious Indian food can be when prepared properly.

Norm ordered : Papadi chaat Onion pakora Chili chicken Tadaka daal Matar mushroom Baigan bharta Badami kheer Gulab jamun The standout dishes were Papadi chaat  and Tadaka daal. Papadi chaat was made with chick peas  pieces of finely chopped potato  tomatoes  and flour crisps. When Norm have  had chaat before  chaat generally had rice crisps. rice crisps were flour and were just as good. Papadi chaat had a very nice spice tang to Papadi chaat as did almost all the dishes Norm tried. Baigan bharta is roasted eggplant cooked with spices in peanut seasoned coconut sauce. The two desserts -  - kheer and Gulab jamun -  -  were standard for Indian restaurants. Norm like the fact that the servings are small dishes so you can try different things.

When Matka Indian Cuisine had a different owner MyOne thought MyOne saw better ambiance inside.. Right now there is a mirror that is about it.. Just plain walls everywhere.. Booths did look very small and MyOne did not  try it anyways. Interestingly   there was no music either .. c. Sambar is supposed to be a mix of Tamarind water  spices Dal and vegetables like onion. In here only the first ingredient was present. d. When MyOne entered   the Naan tray was empty. When MyOne tried twice later on  they were empty. When MyOne left   they were empty. The owner or manager was right there. But there wasnt sufficient Naan at all. MyOne left without even having an opportunity to taste Naan. My wife who was fortunate to get one piece said Naan was good. c. Andhra Chicken was ok and so was the egg curry. Butter chicken tasted very dry and with no spice. d. What is up with the vegetarian choices  -  egg plant curry and zucchini curry.. Can u not come up with better choices for Sunday buffet  e. The served bottle water which was good but food should be good too which was absent. f. MyOne thought the menu said vegetable biryani. MyOne only saw colored rice. Didnt taste like Biryani. g. Food felt fresh as the website claimed . Only the chef needs to learn to cook better. h. MyOne wouldnt go there for dinner . The owner needs to add some interiors to Matka Indian Cuisine otherwise Matka Indian Cuisine would compete only with the C - Fu next door instead of being a restaurant for dinner.

Ayesha must say  Ayesha were not  disappointed. Nirala Sweets & Restaurant was super crowded however Ayesha got lucky and got a table in two mins. Ayesha ordered Paya  halwa poori  mango lassi  sweet lassi  plain naan and till naan. halwa poori was on point  reminded me of halwa and channay Ayesha used to get at Ayesha's Nano  place in androon Lahore. naan was the best naan Ayesha have had in decades. Perfect softness and equally good after naan was cold. Till naan was quiet close to kulcha. Very good. Sweet lassi was perfect ... the only thing missing was the  jhaag   from fresh lassi in Lahore. Mango lassi was very good too. Ayesha liked Paya the curry was too runny never the less tasted good. Ayesha get really good nihari near home so Ayesha did not  try really good nihari  but from the looks of what Ayesha saw on other people  table really good nihari seemed pretty good. The only thing that was disappointing was they were out of chai and were not making any more.

SpiceBros is clean  bright and colourful  appropriate to the food and culture. Fatema absolutely loved the unique concept of  Bro Bowls  where you choose your  protein   a variety of Indian flavoured curry or vegetable  and then add the garnishes  salads vegetables rice etc . Definitely  unique and bringing a healthier alternative to the rich and indulgent cuisine. Fatema ordered a Channa Samosa bowl  large Bro Bowl and Garlic Naan. All were absolutely delicious and the husband devoured the husband's butter chicken bro bowl. Fatema was extremely satisfied with Fatema's channa samosa  -  a Channa Samosa bowl was served impeccably with just the right amount of chickpea curry and crunch and topped with pomegranates  -  perfection ! All the  bowl  foods are made in front of you  like a sandwich salad bar but the naans are made fresh at the back so Fatema received ours a little later. Fatema did not  mind as it came out hot and fresh  sparkling with  ghee   clarified butter   -  yum ! Highly recommend Garlic Naan ! Prices are reasonable and portion sizes are decent.

Star of India do have a wine list  and while a wine list is  small  a wine list is  also relatively cheap. The bottles were all less than     each  and Jenn got a nice shiraz to go with our dinner.

Oh  how Jenn love getable chat ! Star of India  was absolutely perfect  and Jenn m so glad Jenn took a chance on ordering Star of India. However  not wanting to step totally out of Jenn's comfort zone Jenn ordered Jenn's typical mattar paneer. my typical mattar paneer was good  and not a huge portion so Jenn did not  feel compelled to just keep eating and eating the deliciousness in front of Jenn. Jenn's husband got the tandoor mixed grill which had chicken  shrimp  and lamb. My husband was crazy about it. Like most Indian restaurants  you can pick the level of spice for each entree. The garlic naan was ridiculously puffy and buttery  which Jenn loved. Jenn will definitely return to Star of India. Star of India  much more low - key than India Garden but the food is just as good.

My companion and Karen are new to Toronto and picked Aroma Fine Indian Cuisine just by walking around King St. and looking at the different menus. When Karen finally made Karen's decision and climbed the stairs to Aroma Fine Indian Cuisine Karen were greeted promptly and shown to one of the few empty tables. Some water  along with a basket of chapati and the menus  arrived promptly. Unfortunately  Some water  along with a basket of chapati and the menus were the only items to arrive promptly. When the waiter finally came to Karen's table Karen ordered a couple of Kingfishers and some lamb biryani  an order of saag paneer  and some garlic naan. Karen then waited  and waited  and waited some more. There was a large party that was finally getting a large party that was finally getting its food's food  and serving a large party that was finally getting its food seemed to involve the entire waitstaff. Karen ate Karen's chapati  drink Karen's now - warm water and beer  and after a full    minutes Karen's food finally arrived. Both the main courses were absolutely delicious. some lamb biryani was well - seasoned and had huge chunks of lamb  while saag paneer had a silky texture and excellent flavor. some garlic naan was hot and not too garlicky. saag paneer came without rice even though Karen had ordered a side of basmati but Karen was not  willing to risk waiting for more food so Karen used some garlic naan as a sort of shovel for saag paneer. When Karen were finished eating Karen's waiter gave Karen hot towels for cleaning up and then Karen waited another    minutes for Karen's check. By then Karen were well and truly ready to leave but it was very hard to get anyone  attention. Karen were there about         hours with only about    minutes dedicated to eating.

Aroma Fine Indian Cuisine have a food assortment of vegetarian and non - vegeratian dishes  some of a food assortment of vegetarian and non - vegeratian dishes are quite good. Negatives : The space is crammed with tables  no space to move  no space to walk; there is only one foot or so between the buffet and the first row of tables. Dan was not seated at one of the tables next to the buffet otherwise Dan's review would have been   stars... The food is not the best  lamb is mostly bones  cheese  paneer  not creamy  naan not fresh  too much mayo in the coleslaw salad. The staff not very friendly  or too busy The staff do not  refill dishes half an hour before the buffet closes  even if The staff take new guests . Nobody asked Dan if Dan want something from the bar. Only few options for cold starters and deserts. Dan am comparing with Kama  which is not far away .

Ordered the Tawa Paneer Masala  the Lamb Rogan Josh the Sada Chawal  basmati rice because the Sada Chawal  basmati rice is  not included   and an order of Garlic Naan. drew m no connoisseur of Indian food  but drew know what drew like. the Tawa Paneer Masala was sufficiently cheesy. the Lamb Rogan Josh was well seasoned with spices and hot enough to drew's liking. However  drew did not  think the Lamb Rogan Josh was tender enough. drew was disappointed that the entrees did not  already come with rice.

Even though Silver Spoon have expanded to another location in Scarborough  so that there are now two Silver Spoons the Pickering location has managed to maintain consistent quality  although consistent quality can vary on days. Well  what restaurant does not  have that problem You might be suddenly short - staffed  someone down with the flu   or perhaps one of your deliveries did not  make it on time It is good food. Katya prefer the Pakistani cuisine :  Nihari Haleem not always available  and several of the biryanis. Silver Spoon are now offering Sindhi Biryani on weekends  and Katya m so pleased ! The only way that Katya could get Sindhi Biryani in the past was to make Sindhi Biryani Katya using a packaged spice blend. If you want to get Naan  Katya recommend the Butter Naan. Although the Butter Naan costs a bit more the butter enhancements really take Naan to the next level of browning and savoury tastes. Ok  things sit under the heat lamp but things do not seem to suffer that much  particularly something like Nihari  which is a stew - type dish that can withstand the warming table. Everything has always tasted fresh when Katya have ordered it. Katya find that the samosas are fairly standard  but there are other appetizers which are more exciting. For people who like the dark meat of the chicken Lollypop Chicken is great and consistently good. Katya also enjoy Shami Kabab. If you like fish  do not  skip the Fingerfish  which is consistently tasty. Whenever Katya have been there  which is perhaps once a month or two  for the past five years the portions have been generous. Katya am certainly a fan  and Silver Spoon fills an important niche in the local  Pickering community as a convenient place to pick up some Halal take - away of decent quality.", "name": "Katya"}, {"review_id": "r-NLaGpX4hCMraZ9OukN0AnQ", "user_id": "u-Uaqawx2iD0mT5YP_akJrJw", "date": "2014-06-27 00:28:47", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Oh  Silver Spoon. Heli have  tried to love Silver Spoon. Heli have  given Silver Spoon so many chances. But this just is not  working out anymore. To start :  the food is not  exactly terrible. the food just...not very good. Heli have  tried almost every meat dish  the chana masala  samosas  biriyanis  etc. Indian take - out is hardly known for Indian take - out's healthiness but when you order a veal karahi and get two sad chunks of meat floating in half a container in oil it is  a little disheartening. Add to that the fact that food is often sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long... On the upside :  the chicken biriyani is good bang for your buck  -  especially during the week when the chicken biriyani is  on special. You get a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat. a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat  ready to go so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for your order. There was that one time they ran out of chicken biriyani  which is understandable when the chicken biriyani is  on special  but then offered me a  regular biriyani read : JUST rice  for the same price. Ummm  say what   Heli do love their beef samosas -  it is  just to bad that they NEVER HAVE ANY. Seriously  Heli have been here early in the evening  at random times during the week  and they have loads of sad looking veggie samosas  but no beef. Heli feel like the owners need to do a serious evaluation of what works and does not  work. If you notice you are  always selling out of a certain item  and NOT another   does not  it make sense to up a certain item while downsizing another Who knows. My biggest gripe was the chana masala incident. The last time Heli went in  Heli ordered a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about  but my husband likes . The girl at the counter kind of made a face and said Oh... no. Heli do not  want a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes. Heli was confused. There was a whole tray of a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes there  brimming with chick - pea goodness. a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes not... good today. What What does that mean  Is the taste just  off  or had a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes spoiled  In either event why is there a full tray of  not good  chana masala here for customers to look at  and possible walk out the door with   Heli stared at a full tray of  not good  chana masala  and The girl at the counter motioned at a full tray of  not good  chana masala again Heli was just going to remove a full tray of  not good  chana masala from here anyway. But  um  Heli did not . And Heli was the only person in the store. From the wide glass window  before Heli even stepped in  Heli could see that there was no one else even there. She had not  even come over until Heli would  been standing there for a few minutes. It really bothers me that Heli still really do not  know what was so wrong with an entire tray of food that an entire tray of food would warrant being thrown out  -  and why an entire tray of food HADN T been thrown out immediately if an entire tray of food really could not  be saved. It was clear from the crispiness on the top you know that kind of layer of  kin  that develops   that an entire tray of food had been sitting for a while. Ultimately  Heli m really quite relieved the staff person told me before Heli bought a full tray of  not good  chana masala took a full tray of  not good  chana masala home and got diarrhea or something this would be a much harsher review if that had happened... And Heli guess that says something positive about the customer service  sorta... As more and more Indian food places -  both takeout and dine - in  -  emerge in the region  store owners need to realize that customers are going to eventually become more discerning. Heli really wanted this place to be a favorite  -  after all  this place is  very convenient for me  -  but  sorry Silver Spoon Silver Spoon just do not  make the cut.", "name": "Heli"}, {"review_id": "r-ZAmkMWTSbWQRO-uEzYmR8g", "user_id": "u-pj7M1RIWV0caCp7Kj91JxA", "date": "2014-12-17 03:39:34", "rating": 3.0, "text": "Silver Spoon do not have lots of crowd and it taste is different than other locations.

No corkage fees either ! Norine found quality of food was better -  especially in terms of presentation. Rating on five stars  : Norine ordered the butter chicken      generous amount of white meat good for   people ; shahi paneer    mostly just a heavy cream sauce  -  with really small pieces of paneer cheese ; tandoor Roti     slightly greasy  came in two pieces ; garlic naan     very well seasoned and salted  -  still greasy  - came in two pieces ; papdi chaat      fried tortilla pieces garnished with chick peas  yogurt tamarind cilantro  and various chutneys . Each item cost less than    . This meal complimented nicely with a white wine  :  Pinot Gris Cons : Bombay Mahal Thali has a more of a fast food vibe compared to the other location. Service was kind of off -  lacking speed  or was hard to flag down the waitress at times. You had to walk up to the cash to pay  -  another offset.

Peter have not  been to a Hakka place in a while. Peter used to go regularly to Wok of Asia when Peter was assigned to a long term project in the area. Now that Peter m stationed near Hakka Bros. it was great to find Hakka Bro's. As Peter mentioned  Peter like to try to the Chilli Chicken when Peter go to a Hakka place for the first time. Ordered the CC and Soup special  -    . + tax. The Hot and Sour soup was thick and a decent portion for a combo soup. However  though The Hot and Sour soup had some heat The Hot and Sour soup did not  have any real flavour. Added a bit of salt and that helped. The Chilli Chicken portion was generous. Not a lot of times that Peter do not  finish Peter's meal but Peter had to give up as Peter was going into a food coma ! The chicken was moist and the batter was still crispy when served. The chicken had nice heat with about the right amount of peppers. The rice however was a bit of a mess as The rice smelled off. The trials and tribulations of going there well after the lunch hour. If Peter had to rank Peter's CC experience  it would be Wok of Asia first  Hakka Bro's a close second Asian Garden then Hakka   ... dead last...Hakka   . Nonetheless Hakka Bro's is a good find.

Thought Hakka Bro's would turn out to be another good find for Hakka food  as the dishes did look quite good in the pics. Rav ordered fish pakora  chicken Manchurian  Bombay chicken  and Manchurian chicken noodles. Rav's order took a really really long time to be served. All guests that got seated after Rav got All guests that got seated after us's orders before Rav. Then the food arrived .... in reverse order....lol. First came Manchurian chicken noodles then came the two chicken dishes  and finally came the appetizer. Rav were told that fish pakora  chicken takes a long time to be prepared. While one of the owners was upfront and apologized for the delay  appreciate the delay the other owner said Rav had ordered after all the other guests....which was just made up. But the delay was not  really a big deal. Sometime some dishes may take longer for any number of reasons it is  very understandable. Rav's experience of the dinner here was not  really affected by the wait for the food.... but by the food. Food arrived  backwards  but looked good. Both the deep fried dishes :  fish pakora  chicken and Bombay chicken had a bitter after - taste with every single bite. Both the deep fried dishes :  fish pakora and Bombay chicken tasted of stale overused oil. Clearly the fryer oil was being reused way too much and not being cleaned. This is quite unacceptable as it should be very obvious for any cook to notice that the fryer oil is not fit for cooking anymore. The chicken Manchurian had tons of cornflour.... both for coating The chicken Manchurian and for thickening the gravy. The chicken Manchurian was still edible while piping hot  but as the fi started cooling down... The chicken Manchurian just became more and more disgusting. Manchurian chicken noodles were average at best had a strong flavour of some stock powder or flavouring. So Manchurian chicken noodles was not  to Rav's liking. But Rav guess that is  Hakka Bro's's recipe. Rav do think that Hakka Bro's has the potential to be good. But at this point  a lot of effort is needed on Hakka Bro's's part. Hakka Bro's is quite popular  and seemed busy enough.... which means Hakka Bro's must be appealing to the taste of some guests.

Esther went to the bank to get cash because Hakka Bro's said Esther would get additional free chicken wings. However  Esther called back to say you know what Esther would just pay with debit card but then Hakka Bro's had already finished with Esther's order.

Thought Hakka Bro's would turn out to be another good find for Hakka food  as the dishes did look quite good in the pics. Rav ordered fish pakora  chicken Manchurian  Bombay chicken  and Manchurian chicken noodles. Rav's order took a really really long time to be served. All guests that got seated after Rav got All guests that got seated after us's orders before Rav. Then the food arrived .... in reverse order....lol. First came Manchurian chicken noodles then came the two chicken dishes  and finally came the appetizer. Rav were told that fish pakora  chicken takes a long time to be prepared. While one of the owners was upfront and apologized for the delay  appreciate the delay the other owner said Rav had ordered after all the other guests....which was just made up. But the delay was not  really a big deal. Sometime some dishes may take longer for any number of reasons it is  very understandable. Rav's experience of the dinner here was not  really affected by the wait for the food.... but by the food. Food arrived  backwards  but looked good. Both the deep fried dishes :  fish pakora  chicken and Bombay chicken had a bitter after - taste with every single bite. Both the deep fried dishes :  fish pakora and Bombay chicken tasted of stale overused oil. Clearly the fryer oil was being reused way too much and not being cleaned. This is quite unacceptable as it should be very obvious for any cook to notice that the fryer oil is not fit for cooking anymore. The chicken Manchurian had tons of cornflour.... both for coating The chicken Manchurian and for thickening the gravy. The chicken Manchurian was still edible while piping hot  but as The chicken Manchurian started cooling down... The chicken Manchurian just became more and more disgusting. Manchurian chicken noodles were average at best had a strong flavour of some stock powder or flavouring. So Manchurian chicken noodles was not  to Rav's liking. But Rav guess that is  Hakka Bro's's recipe. Rav do think that Hakka Bro's has the potential to be good. But at this point  a lot of effort is needed on Hakka Bro's's part. Hakka Bro's is quite popular  and seemed busy enough.... which means Hakka Bro's must be appealing to the taste of some guests. So Rav guess you can give Hakka Bro's a shot and might have a better experience than Rav did.

Currently a grade  A  Maricopa inspection is posted. The buffet line started with a savory donut that seemed fresh made and was not  oily at all. Next came a few vegetable soups. Pepper thought the rasam  tamarind based  one had much more flavor than the sambar but a few vegetable soups were very light with vegetables. The rice dishes were made from long grain rice and were very fluffy. Chennai Chettinaad Palace had dum aloo baby potato curry   channa palgk spinach chickpeas Fresh plain naan bread Chennai Chettinaad Palace offered   meat dishes and one egg dish and offered three desserts and some beverages. Pepper found that many of the vegetable dishes ran spicier than the meat dishes. Most tasted good to Pepper. Pepper did not  care for two dishes that Pepper tried due to two dishes that Pepper tried were just too foreign to Pepper and two dishes that Pepper tried might not really be bad but dhal tadka looked fun but lentil dumplings in yogurt Pepper could not  get down and the upma vegetarian dish looked like potatoes to Pepper but the upma vegetarian dish was porridge with vegetables that Pepper also could not  get down. of three desserts were interesting. The gulab jamun was like tiny donuts that were soaked in something fragrant and sweet and the halwa was a vegetable packed carrot pudding.

Now growing up in a family of Indian chefs and doing Ryan's own Indian cooking there was only one restaurant that Ryan like to visit and only one restaurant that Ryan like to visit was the Rajbhoj in the university area. When  Ryan first went to check out Nirvana Ryan was pleasantly surprised to see that the owner was also a chef at Lolas making the Lolas beef tips. If anyone has ever tasted the Lolas beef tips the lolas beef tips is also close as you get to original Portuguese cuisine. Now about Nirvana  ; -  it is more about carrying out than dining in. Once you set that expectation you would be fine. Another thing to keep in mind is that not all Indian food is spicy. Anything that involves cream will be bland for the most part. What the reader Avi A said about the food being bland; -  any lentils or korma will always have some blandness associated for any lentils or korma. If you want something with a flavor and a kick here are some options; -   Chilli chicken Pepper Chicken Any south Indian chicken Curry fish  - Yes this is really good For you non vegetarians ; -   Chama masalla Any peas and mushroom combinations Any kadai combinations The coconut chicken is also good but dont expect The coconut chicken to be spicy. The staff is very friendly and The staff do take feedback. So if you have to say something tell The staff. It will only help improve The staff's cusine.

Jacob wasted most Jacob's lunch break roaming around uptown  now on foot looking for the restaurant. the restaurant is neatly tucked away in some building on MLK blvd  not really S Tryon which is probably what caused all Jacob's confusion.

Chicken Tikka Masala was awesome Chicken Tikka Masala was very mild which was nice since the potatoes and egg plant was quite spicy. Jacob went again today ordering Chicken Tikka Masala again  the chili chicken or pepper chicken looked great but Jacob's stomach has been sensitive to spicy lately  hope that passes. The sides were Aloo Bhindi  potato okra Navratan Korma and Jacob got a mango lassi. This all came out to ten dollars Jacob swear it was pushing five pounds of food. Jacob should have weighed it once Jacob got back to the office. Chicken Tikka Masala once again was great  Navratan Korma was mildly spiced and the pineapple really made Navratan Korma stand out. But Aloo Bhindi is what Jacob was excited about the most. Jacob had no idea Okra was a big deal out of the south east  probably because Jacob's mid western GF had never heard of Okra. Aloo Bhindi was very good  almost tasted like the same spices from the eggplant potato curry but not as spicy.

Gone were the friendly owners  replaced by a new crop of much younger  less interested employees. Brendon can recall on not once  but at least   to occassions going here shortly after   am for an early lunch and Nirvana II was closed. Brendon have  walked in at    :    am and they are  still setting up Prices went up  small changes to the menu items started showing up and the coma - inducing  extra scoops of food that really defined the value of their offering started to wane. In other words  now you are  getting too much food  instead of WAYYY too much food  for     instead of   . Subtle - but impactful to the discerning lunch goer. One correctable  subtle issue that popped up  and still persists today as Brendon pull another one out of Brendon's mouth while chewing and writing this review  is exhibited by the fact that Nirvana II cook with in - tact  full - sized Cardamom pods and cloves. Now in and of itself  this is not at all an issue  and in fact encouraged as the subtle flavors are a terrific layer of flavor. The problem exists when in - tact  full - sized Cardamom pods and cloves are not removed prior to serving the dish and so you will  occassinally get a mouthfull of surprise when you bite into an entire Cardamom pod which can simply destroy your pallette for the next several minutes. It  a rookie mistake  that can be easily changed and make a subtle improvement to their quality. Unfortunately after some serious evaluation of Nirvana II for several weeks  if not months  Brendon still come here pretty much weekly because Nirvana II is  the closest place to Brendon's office  Brendon can no longer recommend Nirvana II to folks who may have an Indian food itch burning in folks who may have an Indian food itch burning in their appetites's appetites. The subtle changes that the Aroma management team has made have deteriorated the overall offering beyond Brendon's comfort zone. In fact  the line out the door that used to exist for Nirvana II is gone  -  the people have spoken !  ! The other factor here is that Persis Biriyani opened up a place across the street in the Latta Arcade. In another month or so  after they work out the kinks  Brendon would expect Persis Biriyani to crush Nirvana II on every facet of Persis Biriyani's offering.

Haynus think the  Indo - Chinese  section is something unique that reflects the regional differences that often get glossed over in Indian cuisine. The food is flavorful  and service is fast. Haynus's two complaints :     something always seems to get miscommunicated to the kitchen regarding the spiciness of the dish. Not too hot -  -  too mild  ! This has been verified when Haynus look at Haynus's cheque -  - they list the spiciness requested next to the dish. While quick to refill water  if you order any other beverage  water gets forgotten. Haynus's soda tea glass is empty  and Haynus eventually have to ask the waiter for a refill. In terms of service this is a big issue for me  personally.

Fast  - During lunch  most of the food in OM Restaurant's special lunch menu is already prepared and kept warm  so getting your food is very fast. b. Selection  -  Very simple and clear cut. All types of curry and spice levels that you would want. c. The ambiance  -  Very utilitarian in decor  design and feeling. Greg do not  mind it but it is on the very inexpensive mode  unlike other restaurants. d. The food  -  The most important aspect. Greg love lamb so Greg ordered the Lamb Vindaloo. This is Greg's second time ordering the Lamb Vindaloo. The first order time Greg came here the Lamb Vindaloo was very mild. This second time  Greg asked for the Lamb Vindaloo to be hotter and they said the Lamb Vindaloo naturally was going to be anyway. Greg do admit  the spice was just right and the lamb was very tasty. The Chicken Tikka Masala was okay not too inspiring  Greg also had the Alloo Goobi and the Alloo Goobi was good So three dishes between us two. The naan bread is darn good. The food is generally pretty decent ! e. Service  -  Top notch and will help you to order what you want. Excellent service ! f. Why not   star  Greg am not sure. Is it the paper plates Is it the fast foodiness style of OM Restaurant Is it the utilitarian feel or the fact that when Greg am there it is generally empty Not sure. The food here is good the Greg feel is awesome and Greg will be coming back for sure. GK says  check it out !

Kart have tried many of the other popular Indian restaurants and none of many of the other popular Indian restaurants have come closer to Mint  until last month. One of Kart's friend recommended OM Restaurant to Kart and said that food is cooked in front of you and the prices are reasonable. Kart bookmarked OM Restaurant on Yelp and Kart finally went for OM Restaurant one day. OM Restaurant's located on a plaza by     and Eastern. a plaza by and Eastern is always busy with many restaurants in OM Restaurant so parking might be a small issue. OM Restaurant is not lavish like many other Indian restaurants  OM Restaurant have TV where some Indian music is played but over all OM Restaurant's atmosphere is more like  Roberto . The owners are Nepalese  and the food is mainly north Indian with some that have obvious Nepalese fusion to the food. Kart always get two curries  naan and basmati rice at OM Restaurant. So far Kart have tried Chicken Tikka Masala  Palak Panner  Spinach w  cottage cheese  Kart's fav. Chilli Chicken  Chicken Karai  and OM Restaurant's Garlic Naan. Kart think OM Restaurant has the most authentic Indian flavor of any restaurant and the food is cooked fresh in front of you. the prices are also very low compared to Taj and Mint. and OM Restaurant's an excellent place for take out meals. When Kart first went to OM Restaurant OM Restaurant were running a promotion of     off the entire bill for only month of March. This made the deals even more special. Kart also saw that OM Restaurant do deliveries now. Kart highly recommend that you stop by to try out OM Restaurant's sampler plates Thali  which come with   -   entrees and   -   side dishes. OM Restaurant also have groupon and amazon living social deals.

Sophie like the idea of this method the food is served -  with the servers coming around periodically with different dishes and scooping out portions of whatever you like. The plus sides to this method is that    the food was generally hot and fresh when served  although there were some exceptions  and    because the same dishes came around in cycles you could get more of the select ones you liked. The main downside was that your meal depended on the timing of the dishes. If you were  off cycle sometimes things came in weird orders. Also  if you are vegetarian  you could be waiting a long time between dishes coming out. The food itself was well - executed and delicious. The service was enthusiastic and well - meaning but could use some ironing out of the new - restaurant kinks.

The goat was fork tender and the flavor was slightly sour but complimented The goat perfectly. A side of ratia brought everything together.

So Tandoori Grill opened next to a liquor store on   th. Booze and Indian food next to one another  AMAZING. Julia could not  find a menu online and after begging for help from twitter and still no response Julia just called Tandoori Grill up. Hi Julia do not  have a menu so Julia am just going to guess at what Tandoori Grill have and can Tandoori Grill tell Julia if Julia can order it or not The friendly lady on the phone was very accommodating and everything Julia wanted  Tandoori Grill could provide Julia with. Julia ordered vegetable samosas  vegetable pakoras butter chicken  lamb biryani and three plain naan. What Julia did not  realize is that butter chicken along with lamb chops  tandoori mix platter and shish kabab are chef  specials so butter chicken along with lamb chops  tandoori mix platter and shish kabab come with a piece of naan already and a salad  Julia loved everything about Tandoori Grill except that salad is pretty much nonexistent . Julia was greeted with all smiles when Julia arrived to pick up Julia's order  the couple who run Tandoori Grill are very nice. The woman who took Julia's order on the phone remembered Julia did not have a menu so gave Julia one and told Julia one is posted on Tandoori Grill's facebook page. Julia got home and ripped into our meal  and Julia was very impressed. This ai not no pre made frozen samosas  pakoras or naan. You can tell three plain naan was made with tender love and care  nice and pillowy  Julia wanted to take a nap on three plain naan. three plain naan also wasn;t covered in burned bits  like some naan  which Julia assume comes from a dirty tandoori oven. The samosas and pakoras were exceptional and very tasty. butter chicken was also excellent  Julia am not a fan of the giant chicken chunks  and butter chicken was nicely cut in bite size portions and the sauce was tangy and flavourful. The lamb in lamb biryani was cooked perfectly  nice and moist. So those who drive past Tandoori Grill or live in the area and go  Julia wonder if Tandoori Grill is  good Tandoori Grill is ! and Tandoori Grill's prices are also good considering other indian restaurants in the area.

Sasha ordered the food rather smoothly. However  Tandoori Grill immediately called back to chastise us for ordering one naan  instead of two. In any case  Sasha waited for one hour and a half for our order. Tandoori Grill is miles away  and Tandoori Grill promised our order in    minutes. Alas the food arrived....and the food was lukewarm.... two dishes Sasha ordered were missing  substituted by two other dishes Sasha did not order..... worst thing the food was not very good. After complaining to the owner of Tandoori Grill  the owner of the establishment agreed to refund us our money. the owner of the establishment requested that Sasha box up delivered dishes and the owner of the establishment would come by to pick delivered dishes up... needless to say  as with the rest of the owner of the establishment's actions the owner of the establishment screwed up this part as well. Sasha waited until    PM for the owner of the establishment  and after exchanging half - dozen phone calls it became clear that the owner of the establishment got hopelessly lost and increasingly frustrated. So....Sasha never got our refund. The summary  Tandoori Grill got     plus tip and delivery for the tasteless food Sasha did not order... and Sasha spent     on the inedible meal and a wasted evening dealing with incredibly rude business owner who somehow felt it was our fault Sasha received the wrong order.

Portions were hefty  except maybe the lamb in lamb korma  and justified pricing IMO. Quality - wise it wo not  be the best Indian food you have  ever eaten but it hits the spots that need to be hit when you are  hankering for Indian. chicken biryani was reasonably flavourful and quite plentiful lamb korma was fairly well made  and vegetable curry had a nice sauce and filled to the brim with veggies  but seemed like they may have used a package of frozen peas carrots corn  Hmmm .

Lena was probably one of the first customers... Tandoori Grill were still a little unorganized. But WOW ! That was amazing food ! !  ! The spicing was heavenly. The dishes  -  each one was high quality and delicious. Lena thought the weird way the butter chicken came in a small portion with salad was a tacky marketing trick but no matter  the food was amazing. Tandoori Grill quickly became our favourite takeout. Why my   stars Because in a very short amount of time  things seem to have changed for the worse. The serving size has shrunk significantly  -  and Lena would be ok with that as this is expensive food to make -  but what bothers me is that the consistency has turned to soup. the butter chicken had about six tiny pieces of meat and then a watery sauce that would not even hold to the rice. Every thing is still quite flavourful  but very much a liquid  -  even the vegetable dishes. The lamb dish had too many fat chunks for my taste. The naan had turned a bit greasy  and although Lena only ordered    Lena seem to have received enough for an army  -  at least six pieces. Our meat samosas were vegetable. The rice is way too expensive... Lena have  always thought The rice should be free.

Alexandra are  well versed in Indian food so Alexandra knew what Alexandra wanted but Our host  also doubling as waiter offered to help Alexandra with any questions Alexandra might have had. They happened to be having an incredibly busy night for takeouts they must have been working on    or more different orders by the time Alexandra left . But they served Alexandra quickly and with smiling faces. It was super neat because you could see the cooks through a window working away in the kitchen  providing for some entertainment. Alexandra's food was quite possibly the best Indian food Alexandra have  ever had  granted  Alexandra do not  eat Indian food very often . Alexandra ordered beef samosas for appetizers. The pastry was crispy and flakey and the filling was perfectly seasoned. Alexandra wanted more but had to save room for the main course. Next Alexandra ordered a meat and veggie curry  chicken masala and blank lentil curry  with both garlic and butter naan personally  they taste similar so if you are  pinching pennies just go for butter naan . Alexandra were greatly surprised with how incredible everything tasted. Alexandra's host always came by Alexandra's table to make sure Alexandra's waters were filled and that Alexandra were satisfied with everything. Our host  also doubling as waiter was hilarious. Alexandra would honestly go back just for Our host  also doubling as waiter but thankfully Our food is another excellent reason to go back as well. Alexandra will say  Tandoori Grill is a bit odd  maybe even sketchy  considering Tandoori Grill is  next to a liquor store but all that aside Tandoori Grill is  not very off putting at all.

Tandoori Grill Makes Stephen's mouth water just thinking about the spices. However  it took Tandoori Grill over   months to open the bloody doors from the time Stephen saw the sign posted. Do not  play with Stephen's appetite like that ! Stephen got around to trying Tandoori Grill out last week as Tandoori Grill just opened that weekend. Stephen like Stephen's curries as much as the next guy but some co - workers suggested Stephen try the Biryani. So Stephen gave the Biryani a shot and ordered a side of butter naan  which is apparently not allowed in the Indian eating playbook. Stephen's co - worker described it as eating mashed potatoes with rice  -  personally Stephen do not  see the problem . What Stephen found really unusual is that about two minutes after ordering Stephen got a phone call from an unknown number and an unknown number was a lady working at Tandoori Grill. a lady working at the Tandoori Grill called to ask Stephen if Stephen wanted Stephen's Biryani medium hot or very hot. Stephen told a lady working at the Tandoori Grill to make Stephen sweat and Stephen think a lady working at the Tandoori Grill might have misinterpreted Stephen as coming on to a lady working at the Tandoori Grill. Chalk it up as an error in translation. So Stephen m eating the Biryani right  and the Biryani tastes really good ! The serving size is quite large for Stephen's      frame but you will  never hear Stephen complain. There is a lot of chicken and a lot of spice here. Maybe a bit too much spice. Stephen did catch a few cloves and some bark looking thing that tasted really bitter. Minor grievances for Stephen since Stephen do like to experience ethnic and exotic flavours. And boy did a lady working at the Tandoori Grill make Stephen sweat ! the Biryani was spicy too  HAR HAR  ! You vanilla faces out there might want to opt for the medium spicy; a caramel face like Stephen has been desensitized to the hot stuff.

Not the best kababs Peter have  had. Peter m not a fan of onions in salad kabab rolls either. Nothing was bad and nothing was that good. If you do get the kababs then Peter would  recommend the chicken ones instead of beef. Peter did like the Afghani chicken because the Afghani chicken had that nice smoked taste to the Afghani chicken but if that is  your thing then a Turkish Afghan restaurant is probably better. The naans were not  bad at all and Peter wo not  comment on the curries since Peter do not  really like the curries but others thought the curries were okay. If you wanna play it safe then stick with the  tandoori corner  part of Tandoori Style Restaurant's menu.

Spicy Garden was very clean  with definite thought given to decor with all the IKEA hanging lampshades they were using. On to the food ! Karen had the spicy garlic chicken combo  which came with   spring rolls and a bowl of fried rice. Super saucy with breaded chicken with a spicy kick  -  and super yummy as well. Karen m sure Karen's stomach is currently glowing neon red from the plentiful sauce right now. Karen also tried out Karen's fellow diners  chili chicken and paneer with chili. my fellow diners  chili chicken and paneer with chili were also unexpectedly delicious. paneer with chili was breaded which Karen was not  used to but Karen guess that is  how it is  - did not  deter Karen from enjoying every firm and faintly cheesy bite. To end off  Karen all shared a deep fried banana dessert with vanilla ice cream which was just the perfect sweet and cooling way to end off a spicy  fragrant meal.

My theory is that Mantra Masala is hoping that there are some Indian - food lovers within a   - mile radius who do not  want to venture far. If some Indian - food lovers within a   - mile radius who do not  want to venture far were me then Misti would be pleased with the offerings.

Misti asked for hotter than  white people hot   and Mantra Masala interpreted that nicely. naan was fine  not spectacular. However  the real disappointment were the prices  especially given the mouse - sized portion of rice that comes with an entree. While     for   is not an expensive dinner  when you are staring at an entree  a side  a peck of rice and a basket of naan you start to fantasize about the     for   spread you could be noshing on at the Namaste buffet.

One complaint Candee would have is that it took not one not two  but THREE visits to Mantra Masala before Candee could eat there due to Mantra Masala's weird schedule. Closed on Mondays. Closed during the afternoon during Mantra Masala's off - peak hours. Candee get that it saves Mantra Masala money to close during this time but this is Vegas and Candee would expect a restaurant to be open at   p.m.", "name": "Candee"}, {"review_id": "r-Wpys79WDj7zEWvAbV5Tz4A", "user_id": "u-AQcMZ74yQNx7JsdD-QQ0SA", "date": "2013-05-30 23:16:23", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Forget Mantra Masala....

After a few search from fellow yelpers Mike decided that Mantra Masala is exactly where Mike need to be. Luckily Mike managed to kidnap   buddies of Mike to help Mike  experiment  a little bit more since this was Mike's second time ever having Indian food. Both Mike's friends were new to Indian food as well Mike figured Mike would  order the Mantra  Mixed Grill which consist of most of Mantra Masala's specialties for everyone to share; Tandoori chicken  Chicken Tikka  Bazari Chicken  and Barah Kabab  lamb . All of which were pretty tender and spiced really well. Our server looked at us if like that was not  enough so Mike asked Our server to recommend us another dish to which Our server concluded that Mike should try the Chicken Tikka Masala. OMGggg the Chicken Tikka Masala was amazing !  ! Mike did not  know this  but the Chicken Tikka Masala is exactly what Mike have  been looking for !  ! Not Curry ! Spiced  boneless chicken roasted in clay oven cooked in creamy tomato sauce. Mike wanted to call Mike's mom and cry because the Chicken Tikka Masala was so darn good ! ;  There were plenty of sauce left that Mike dipped our Garlic Nan leavened bread baked with fresh chopped garlic  into it poured some over rice  and also dipped some of the Mantra  Mixed Grilled stuff into it as well  : X  Mike could see why Mike wanted us to order the  nd dishes because the  nd dishes were not that big at all. Just enough which is perfect because Mike do not  need to stuff ourselves with too much goodness. A tad bit pricier BUT over at Mantra Masala it is  clear that Mantra Masala implement the philosophy   quality over quantity.

The naan can be hit or miss here. One time The naan tasted like pita bread maybe they ran out   and another time The naan tasted like OK naan out of the tandoor. The Chick Tikka Masala is decent. Vindaloo is not great  in fact most of their curries  like Mantra Masala  taste alike just different heat levels. Have tried the tandoor mixed grill and the tandoor mixed grill was satisfactory. The malai kofta is decent but the gravy is more like a soup. Also  one thing Richie noticed about Mantra Masala is that the dishes are consistently underseasoned. Richie read somewhere that most Americans consider Indian food to be salty so maybe this is an overreaction to that Not sure. But Richie always have to add salt to the entrees.

Regina tried other pieces that are not chicken tikka  and other pieces that are not chicken tikka tasted kinda grainey so Regina stuck to the chicken tikka -  -  -  -  - Chicken Tikka : this taste the most familiar. But...Regina have not seen such a small piece. -  -  -  -  - Masala chai tea : Masala chai tea kinda taste like the bigelow spiced chai tea that Regina could easily steep at home  office  anywhere.

Elina have to admit that this dish has a lot of food for Me and my boyfriend which means the portion size was definitely worth the price. However  in terms of food quality this dish was not that great at all. The meat was SUPER dry and there was no sauce which made it very difficult to eat. Elina also ordered this mango drink and Elina thought this mango drink was average. After the main course  Elina wanted to try a dessert. Elina ordered :  Rasmalai  -  A popular Indian dessert made of fresh cottage cheese  stewed with pistachio flavored reduced milk    .   . For a dessert  Elina must say a dessert is  the SWEETEST thing Elina have ever had. a dessert basically tastes like frozen reduced condensed milk with pistachio bits in frozen reduced condensed milk with pistachio bits in it.

The Tandori chicken was flavourful as well..... but no breasts  white meat  ... The Tandori chicken  like Butter Chicken  were thighs and drumsticks. The spiciest dish on the buffet were the pakora   which was a surprise as the buffet also had the chick peas  which are usually a bit spicy  but here were rather bland . Unfortunately for Jim  the best part of the buffet was the naan bread...which is a staple at every Indian restaurant.

A separate cold bar had all the fixings  like a simple salad  mango chutney raita  rice pudding. There was even a small case of chocolate  vanilla  mango  and strawberry ice cream sherbet. The best part  -  everything was great ! The naan went fast and was gone by the time Jessica went to the buffet so the waiter host brought My husband and Jessica a fresh serving from the kitchen.

You could tell that the waiter host loves the waiter host's restaurant and the waiter host's job. the waiter host made My husband and Jessica feel welcome and answered all My husband and Jessica's questions about the food and restaurant  and the silly Canadian HST tax . The next night  Jessica ended up at Bombay Palace again  -  this time for dinner. Instead of a buffet  Jessica ordered from the menu and were completely blown away. The chicken tikka masala was savory with the perfect balance of onions  tomatoes  and green peppers. Jessica's chicken korma was the best Jessica have  ever had. Not too sweet not too creamy  and a wonderful hint of coconut and ginger. My chicken korma was moist and plentiful. Just thinking about My chicken korma makes Jessica want to go back to Toronto. At lunch the day before  the waiter host urged My husband and Jessica to try the garlic naan. Jessica were so full that Jessica did not   so Jessica ordered the garlic naan at dinner. Words cannot describe the deliciousness of that bread. Most places use too much garlic and overpower The naan; not Bombay Palace. The naan was slightly crispy on the outside  nice and fluffy on the inside  and the garlic just hit The naan out of the park.

Anyone who has eaten Indian food in other places in the valley and other cities in US know that to get really good Indian food you have to pay    . Not here.

Food is healthy. sridhar have been eating here since      and not had a bad stomach or any other issues. Like sridhar said dinners are served hot and fresh... Points that some people might not like : Owner sometimes looks like Owner has the burden of the world on Owner  very sad... Ambience is average as Ambience goes  not something that you look forward to. Very casual atmosphere so sometimes  sridhar find multiple tables dirty and sridhar just find a good spot and fill water sridhar... Treat a good spot like home.

Din are Asian   know Indian food very well. Big disappointment. Bland  tasteless food. There was no spice or taste. Din give this place   star for many reasons. First let me tell you  Din am not one to write reviews  unless Din am very impressed with a business or thoroughly disappointed. Din called the owner earlier in the evening  as Din wanted to purchase a Groupon for the Buffet. a Groupon was for      or   people. Din were    my Husband me's husband my Husband   me my Husband me's Mum. So Din asked the owner about it as Din wanted to know if this place offered a Senior citizens discount  so that Din could buy a Groupon for the both of us   pay for my Husband me's Mum. the owner then told me  that Din need not buy the Groupon   that Din could come in   the owner would give Din the Groupon price for all three  with drinks included. the Groupon price for all three  with drinks included would have been    per person for the Buffet. So Din was happy with that. Din got there this place looked dingy dark   gloomy. With the rain outside  it only made it worse. The food seemed like leftovers from lunch. All the dishes were with curry stains from lunch. Not Cleaned up. The Rice was just warming up in a rice cooker The Rice was at the very bottom of a rice cooker  making it obvious that The Rice was leftover. Din understand that this place can not  waste food  but at least  clean up the dishes  so that this place respect this place's customers. this place needs cleaning up   the floor needs to be mopped. Din looked around decided to just give this place a try  since Din were there already. The food was nothing as expected. Din was so looking forward to Indian food. Sadly  The food was nothing good. Very basic overall  tasteless. Din finished our meal   came up to pay the owner says  the owner charged Din's Mum an    year old lady full price of       Din's Husband   me the Groupon rate. Din was like  what is  going on That  not what the owner said to me on the phone. When Din mentioned it the owner says the owner can not  do that   also says that the owner did not  charge Din for the drink. Really  Din just had a can of Sprite. That  it. the owner promised us drinks   said this place offered anything  tea coffee Mango Lassi all soft drinks   the Groupon rate for all   of us. Extra    is nothing to write about at all. No big deal. Tha would have been our tip anyway But it is  just that you need to keep your word. If the food was exceptional  Din would not  bother at all. the food was basic food. Din cook better Indian food at home. And this charge was for an    year old lady  who barely eats anything at all. Specially for dinner. All Din can say is  this place lost a Customer Many more with us. Din am a person who introduces people to restaurants when Din find a good one. So this place is one place Din would never go to   would advice people to think twice  unless of course people want to eat  bland  tasteless  leftovers.", "name": "Din"}, {"review_id": "r-KY5nMWd5issEwDfbAAYI8Q", "user_id": "u-5UFCvsTSJMfPqQFQLckIQw", "date": "2016-11-25 04:25:13", "rating": 1.0, "text": "The staff here is extremely rude.

Tenny used to come here when Thulasi Kitchen was a different Indian restaurant. Right when Tenny walked in  the decor and cleanliness was very inviting. The waiter was very attentive. The waiter seated us right away. Tenny had paneer tikka roll and papri chat to begin with. paneer tikka roll came with a delicious green sauce - Tenny would give       for a delicious green sauce  paneer tikka roll on the other hand was wrapped in a package tortilla and the filling was not  as great. papri chat cane out quite dry but Tenny must say  the owner was attentive enough to rectify our chat with more sauce. That was awesome service. Tenny also had masala dosa and chole batura. masala dosa and chole batura were splendid. Tenny coconut chutney and the Sambar with masala dosa was very authentic. chole batura was awesome. Right kind of spice and the bread was crisp and tasty. Tenny ended up ordering another batura to go. Tenny ended our meal with madras coffee which Tenny would recommend to anyone coming here. madras coffee which Tenny would recommend to anyone coming here had the filter coffee taste Tenny also look forward to in madras coffee.

If Sam eat gluten Sam get sick. Dinner becomes a not great experience after a few hours. You can stop reading now if you see where this review is headed and do not  feel like my issues are relatable to you. Back to this review. After walking in on the Indian side of Tadka Restaurant with Sam's sister and seeing literally no one in the seating area at   : pm on a Sunday  Sam were a little nervous. Sam tracked down a waiter at the bar on the Bamboo Garden side    restaurant  -    sides    entrances  but the Bamboo Garden side    restaurant  -    sides    entrances connect in the middle . Sam were seated in a booth only slightly above ground level and given menus. Being somewhat familiar with Indian dishes and starving after Christmas shopping  Sam made some selections -  birbali shorba very zesty  and samosa VERY SPICY  to start. Sam explained   Sam m allergic to wheat  Sam's sister can not  have nuts . Sam were planning on sticking with curry dishes with rice for Sam and some naan for Sam's sister. a waiter assured Sam the sauces were prepared only with spices  no wheat flour  nothing. Granted Sam have  eaten Indian before with success so Sam knew which dishes had been previously safe. But Sam were trying Tadka Restaurant. Sam's sister tried the Alu Ghobi  not on the menu but still offered if you ask  and the Chicken Tikka Masala  which was delicious . Sam tried the Lamb Saag  again  not on the menu but offered  which was the best buttery spinach version Sam have  ever had  as well as the Chettinad an earthy dish with whole chilies. The rice was a bit of a disappointment as The rice was a tad over done  and the spices cooked with The rice were not  Sam's taste. By the time Sam had finished our meal and packed up our many leftovers more customers had joined us so Sam did not  feel so strange and alone. All was well...until a couple hours later. Sam m not sure where Sam went wrong  if there indeed was gluten in one of the sauces  or what not. All Sam's cherished leftovers had to be thrown away. Sam would have given the restaurant   stars with a warning to fellow celiacs but then Sam remembered the bathroom at Tadka Restaurant. Let  just say Sam have  seen nicer bathrooms as truck stops. So   stars is the best Sam can do for Sam's personal review.", "name": "Sam"}, {"review_id": "r-YBWmPD2WMx1Su8a5L60iew", "user_id": "u-nzt7SwH8gXccEa5l_RXRUQ", "date": "2013-10-05 17:24:25", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Great attentive service with a wonderful buffet selection.

Tadka Restaurant is very big but Tadka Restaurant is  also connected with a Chinese food place next door so it is  a bit confusing when you walk in.

The bathrooms were immaculate too lol Danielle were literally the only people in there at this time so Danielle can tell ya the service was fast haha Danielle ordered the chicken tikka masala because Danielle m a coward and always order the chicken tikka masala when Danielle want Indian food haha. Danielle also had naan bread and Danielle ordered two appetizers. Danielle's usual -  vegetable samosa and something different this time. Danielle can not  remember the name of it but it was a fried patty type hash brown thing that had spinach and potato inside it and it was really good ! You will  see it on the menu under appetizers  -  you can not  miss it. Just read the description. Danielle's only complaint -  Danielle asked for mild sauce Danielle know Danielle m a wimp  but mild sauce was pretty hot actually. Danielle would  say mild sauce was more on the medium side. Danielle still ate mild sauce but Danielle just hate chugging Danielle's water or soda after every bite. Danielle like to enjoy the taste of Danielle's food -  not burn Danielle's tongue.

So Jacqueline took Jacqueline's friend from out of town here for my friend's birthday. Ordering off the menu is not an easy task. First off for the first    minutes Jacqueline were the only customers in Tadka Restaurant. The waiter  bartender  pretty much everything there kept walking away while Jacqueline were talking to The waiter  bartender. Then when Jacqueline went to order The waiter  bartender second guessed everything. Jacqueline asked for the Aloo Vindaloo and The waiter  bartender said :  the Aloo Vindaloo is spicy. Jacqueline said The waiter  bartender know The waiter  bartender have had the Aloo Vindaloo several times. Jacqueline's friend then ordered off of the chinese food menu and The waiter  bartender stared at my friend and said  what  my friend do not  like indian food The waiter  bartender also questioned Jacqueline's fiance  order when explaining my fiance the dish several times when my fiance acknowledged my fiance understood what my fiance was ordering. Jacqueline ordered the potato cashew rolls only to be disappointed that the potato cashew rolls had no flavor. the potato cashew rolls just tasted like unseasoned mashed potatoes. Jacqueline then went to the bathroom and when came out the main dishes were on the table. Jacqueline asked Jacqueline's fiance and Jacqueline's friend to taste Jacqueline and asked  does this taste like there is milk in there Jacqueline am vegan so Jacqueline specifically ordered Jacqueline's food to ensure there was no dairy. When The waiter  bartender came back The waiter  bartender asked if Jacqueline liked my food  and Jacqueline said  Yes. my food is good  but - And The waiter  bartender cut Jacqueline off and said The waiter  bartender changed Jacqueline's order and mixed my food with another curry. Jacqueline asked The waiter  bartender if there was dairy in my order and The waiter  bartender asked Jacqueline why. Jacqueline told The waiter bartender Jacqueline am a vegan and then The waiter  bartender proceeded to say it was The waiter  bartender's fault Jacqueline did not tell The waiter  bartender. Why should Jacqueline have to tell The waiter  bartender when Jacqueline ordered a curry that did not have dairy in a curry that did not have dairy in it to begin with Who changes someones order and does not  ask  Then not only did The waiter  bartender charge Jacqueline for all of the curry The waiter  bartender brought Jacqueline The waiter  bartender insisted on not just bringing Jacqueline the Aloo Vindaloo  which by the way tasted burnt  but another chickpea curry. so Jacqueline was charged for   Aloo Vindaloos and a chickpea curry and whatever curry was mixed in the first one but Jacqueline was also charged for   different rice dishes because someone brought us plain basmati rice instead of the cumin basmati rice Jacqueline ordered. Jacqueline's bill ended up being outrageous but Jacqueline could not  even discuss My bill because The waiter  bartender would just walk away. A friend came later on and asked for a dirty martini and got something clear in a martini glass. When A friend asked for some olives they told A friend they do not have olives. Jacqueline were afraid to ask how they even attempted to make a dirty martini dirty. Jacqueline will never go back to Tadka Restaurant again. It was a horrible experience.

For some reason Muffin had thought there was an Old Navy somewhere along the line of stores there. Turns out Muffin was incorrect  but Muffin happened to pass by Tadka Restaurant. Muffin figured  since Muffin m here and Muffin have not  had dinner yet why not get some chicken tikka masala. Muffin had only been here once  when Muffin first moved to Cleveland   years ago. Muffin do not  recall how mine's experience was that time only that Muffin did not  leave upset. Muffin sure as hell remember how it was this time... Muffin walked into Tadka Restaurant and stood by the  Please wait to be seated  sign. There were a total of   other parties  all sitting at the booths along the right side. All the waitress happened to be huddled together by the POS system chatting. The notice mine  and the very nice African American waitress walked up to mine and asked mine if Muffin was dining in or taking it to - go. Muffin told the very nice African American waitress's Muffin was dining in  party of  . the very nice African American waitress asked mine if Muffin would like a table or the last empty booth which one just to the right of mine by the door. Muffin told the very nice African American waitress's Muffin would  take the last empty booth  . Tadka Restaurant was practically empty Muffin hate sitting at tables compared to booths  and Muffin figured this line of tables would be easiest for all the customers since all the customers were sitting in this line of tables . the very nice African American waitress processed to clear of all the extra sets of plates  cups  and utensils. Muffin sat down  while the very nice African American waitress fetched some water and the menu and told the very nice African American waitress would  give mine a few minutes to look the menu over. Since Muffin came in with a plan  it did not  take mine long to scan the menu and decide what Muffin wanted :    chicken tikka masala entree and a side of naan. A couple minutes later  the shorter white  plump waitress came up and asked mine if Muffin was ready to order. Muffin gave the shorter white  plump waitress mine's order and the shorter white  plump waitress said the shorter white  plump waitress would put my order right in. my order was cooked much faster than Muffin expected   and within    minutes the  rd waitress came over with mine's food  the  rd waitress. the  rd waitress placed mine order on the table and left. - At this point  everything had been going swell  Muffin had no reasons to complain and Muffin started digging in. Muffin had started eating mine's food and   bites in  Muffin decided it would be nice to have a knife. It just so happens the   latter waitresses :  the plump one and the tall one were  standing by mine's booth. the plump one was helping a customer who had just walked in and the tall one was loitering close behind the plump one. Muffin looked at the plump one and when the plump one made Muffin eye contact Muffin asked  Excuse mine may Muffin have a knife please    -  -  - This is where everything started going to s t. Muffin had appeared to have struck a nerve with Muffin's  sense Muffin looked at mine blankly for a good    second before say yeah... Muffin goes to the POS table grabs a knife and very unenthusiastically hands a knife to mine. Muffin do not  expect someone who has to work the dinner shift on a Friday to be the happiest person in the world but Muffin could not  wait to walk away  and just kind of hastily handed a knife to mine. Now  If you have  read this far you would  probably agree that nothing that is  happened really warrants a complaint or taking the time to write a critical review. It got worse though. Through mine's entire dinner Muffin visited all the other booths   -   times as Muffin ignored to even come near mine. At some point Muffin ran out of water so Muffin placed the cup on the end of the table so that the next passing waitress might fill the cup up and Muffin was being super patient about it. Muffin was the only on the area because by this time a bunch of other tables had filled up and the other waitresses were busy there. Muffin looked mine's direction and specifically at mine's empty cup several times while Muffin poured more water and refused to come mine's direction and made Muffin's best attempt not to make eye contact. Muffin finally got Muffin's attention and asked for some water  and this time Muffin did not  even say a word Muffin just silently got the pitcher  filled up the cup so fast the cup almost spilled and left. By the time Muffin was done eating  Muffin had given up on getting any attention to ask for the check so Muffin just sat there quietly till the  rd waitress realized Muffin was done eating and asked if Muffin needed anything else.", "name": "Muffin"}, {"review_id": "r-waXPZc74gjoUirflRTUxkw", "user_id": "u-THYhJ6bt_1GIzq_HEigPKQ", "date": "2016-08-01 01:25:54", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Pretty disappointed.

Araina ordered the butter chicken which at the time honestly did taste more like an italian  rose style sauce with chicken so because Waterfalls Indian Tapas Bar & Grill was supposed to specialize in Indian Cuisine Araina was a little confused. Also the dishes are not served with rice this offers more of a selection Araina suppose but it is also a little silly when every meal  requires  you purchase rice seperately. The portions Araina do feel are large but the food Araina found was delicious  even if the food Araina found was not  the most authentic Araina did enjoy the meal very much. Service wise Araina was not impressed though  besides that warm and lovely greeting from the host or possible owner the waitress was not attentive and left us waiting for long periods of time. Another downside to almsot anywhere in Toronto it seems now is parking  the street parking only goes to   :    or pm Araina believe so while Araina were waiting for our server parking enforcment could have shown up at anytime which would have forced us to run over and intervine. Not something you want to be worrying about when your trying to enjoy your dining experience. Large enough patio was fairly comfortable but there were not  many people when Araina was there so Araina wonder how comfortable Large enough patio would be packed.

Upon walking in  it became clear pretty quickly that Waterfalls Indian Tapas Bar & Grill was understaffed  -  -  not sure if that is  because of the holiday  but other reviews suggest it may be typical. It took a long to get the attention of either of the two servers  and eventually Luke just grabbed our own menus and plunked ourselves at a table the two servers agreed upon that had not  yet been cleaned up. Our server was  if nothing else  friendly though  and also accommodating to Luke's companion  food allergies. Once ordered  the food took a long time to arrive. Perhaps the kitchen was also understaffed. Our onion bhaji and chicken pakoras were tasty  but onion bhaji were fried slightly too long and so had an edge of burnt taste. The main course was a two - curry special which arrived with a generous portion of both rice and naan. Luke have to give them points for value here      for more than enough food for two people   and the curries were tasty enough  if not terribly memorable. The Chicken Chettinad is a cashew - based dish  which seems somewhat unusual for the typical tikka - masala butter - chicken menu one finds. The other curry Luke chose was a Baingan Bartha  which was...serviceable. a two - curry special which arrived with a generous portion of both rice and naan also came with a portion of raita  a slightly soggy papadom  and a decent lime pickle. Luke have  had much worse Indian and spent more money on it so Luke would consider coming back and trying to order some of the other less common dishes  like the special mango fish dish that was not  available that night. One last note :  there was a pretty egregious band that played     ! sets while were there  covering all the jazz pop songs you have heard a million times before in a style you soon hope to forget.

Cindy purchased a voucher from Living Social worth so when Cindy arrived for our  PM reservation Waterfalls Indian Tapas Bar & Grill had a fair amount of people. Cindy ordered the non - vegetarian platter as an appetizer  the curry special which consisted of chicken chettinad and beef kadhai and the mushroom makini. It took    minutes for us to receive the curry special which consisted of chicken chettinad and beef kadhai. Cindy both thought the curry special which consisted of chicken chettinad and beef kadhai was average but nothing relatively special. Cindy received our meals at  PM  one hour after our arrival. The curry dish Cindy's friend ordered was warm but not fresh the mushroom makini was fresh but the flavour was too much like Cindy was eating butter. Cindy ate about     of the mushroom makini because the butter taste was overwhelming. The service was below average  Cindy had ordered water and when Cindy wanted more there was no one to ask. Upon arrival the table clothes were dirty and the next table was not cleaned. Cindy noticed there were only   chefs in the kitchen    waiters and a manager on a Friday evening. When Cindy received our bill  usually when Cindy have a voucher worth and Cindy did not spend our maximum Cindy would not need to pay tip or the taxes. But in this situation the waiter told us Cindy had to and it was not included with a voucher. So Cindy had to pay the taxes when a voucher would have covered the overall amount  this has never occurred to Cindy as Cindy have used vouchers in the past and if Cindy have not used over the amount given the amount given would be counted as tip. SO Cindy gave the waiter     and on top of that the remainder of a voucher which is    equals     tip which is completely ridiculous for the service Cindy received.

Now Eric know what Eric are  thinking Why did not  Eric speak up sooner  complain to the manager or just get up and leave and Eric would have been within Eric's rights to do all of the above. The truth is  Eric did not  notice how much time was passing because Eric was having a nice drink and good conversation. Does that mean Waterfalls Indian Tapas Bar & Grill should get a better rating Eric's lord no. Eric just know Eric wo not  be making the mistake of eating here again and hopefully Eric can steer some other people away too.

Let me say first off the food is great the patio is great the live music is great. But the kitchen speed is literally the slowest Tanya have EVER experienced  anywhere  EVER. Also  the service is pretty weak  maybe because the serving staff can not  stand the kitchen  and the prices are pretty high for a mid - level experience. Tanya have  put up with it because Waterfalls Indian Tapas Bar & Grill is  one of the nicer places in Kensington  but Tanya can not   in good conscience  keep going back. The last straw was when my boyfriend and Tanya decided to go there for date after a crazy week  and treat my boyfriend and Tanya. That meant Tanya were  going to  have a three course meal with wine. Welll.... Apps took    minutes to get there then the bottle of wine was done by the time the mains came out about AN HOUR after Apps had come  not exaggerating . Tanya are  easy going people and had no where else to be  so Tanya did not  make a fuss  even though Tanya were STARRRVVVING. Tanya ordered more naan a little bit into the meal  which showed up after the food was gone  even though Tanya  tried  to eat slowly so that Tanya would  still have some left . The waiter was nice enough  though The waiter never addressed the fact that Tanya were clearly waiting FOREVER... which makes me think The waiter  so used to it The waiter does not  care about the fact that Tanya were clearly waiting FOREVER anymore. Tanya had planned to have dessert  but by then  my temper was ready to flare so Tanya figured it was safer to just get out of there.

Gillian arrived at   for dinner. it was not  too packed the server brought Gillian Gillian's menu within   minutes and things looked okay  although there was not  a whole lot of selection. Gillian ordered and our pitcher of sangria came relatively quickly. An hour and a half later  our appetizers arrived. Gillian was starving and the chicken tikka masala was cold. minutes later  our plates still had not  been cleared and Gillian asked if our mains were coming. the server mumbled something about how the server would check. Then the server came back and said that the kitchen was  chopping fresh vegetables for the meals  and that was why it had taken almost two hours to come. Then our food finally came and Gillian's paneer was beyond bland. After   and a half hours  our server asked us for the first time how our food was  and Gillian can not  say that Gillian gave a glowing review. Overall our food was not  tasty  dinner appetizer and main  took three hours Gillian's appetizer was cold the server did not  try to make things better after the server had clearly forgotten about our order  even though it was not  that busy  and the bathrooms were kinda gross.

The reservation was for     but only   of us showed up  which Tanya m thankful for otherwise Tanya would  probably still be waiting for Tanya's food. Tanya arrived at   :    and were not offered drinks for half an hour. The drinks drinks took another half hour to show up. Once drinks finally did Tanya placed our order and realized Tanya may be in for a long night. The server was really nice  but Waterfalls Indian Tapas Bar & Grill was severely understaffed for a Saturday night :    servers    cooks and Waterfalls Indian Tapas Bar & Grill. Two hours after Tanya sat down was when Tanya had Tanya's first bite of Tanya's samosa appetizer  which was delicious. It would be another    minutes before our meals would be on the table. Half of our party was finished eating before a couple of friends received a couple of friends's food. No apologies no offers no recognition of how ridiculously long everything was taking. Many tables that arrived after us received Many tables that arrived after us's meals et al before us. The food was fantastic  which is why Tanya m giving   stars and not  . The music was cringe - worthy  a catatonic elevator - music band that soullessly covered greats like Hallelujah  Tanya Will Survive and What a Wonderful World. Music that would have complemented the environment would have been more appropriate. After that band a group of people started setting up for a PLAY... our party marveled at the silence and flickering lights as the actors started constructing the actors's set. Eventually Tanya just could not  stop laughing; from bad music to no music and faulty electricity   plus a now   hour restaurant experience  and Tanya were all colossally late for the second location of our party  which other people were going to be at who were not joining us for dinner . After the birthday girl finished the birthday girl's meal  the birthday girl threw down some cash and left to hold the fort down at the tiki bar. NOT the way for a birthday girl to feel. The bill organizing was a debacle. Tanya tried to organize a split bill system with our server at the beginning  who told us Tanya would  just sort it all out later. As someone who worked in the industry for years  a split bill system is a very bad idea. Tanya figured out Tanya's total plus tax and tip and gave Tanya's cash before other people were even given other people's bill. The restaurant  grand apologetic gesture came in the form of comp - ing about   orders of naan bread  a total of    . For a group of people ordering multiple drinks and bottles of wine  plus a full meal each  that was pretty measly. Tanya do not  blame The server at all The server was a nice fellow who was working really hard  about x harder than anyone else there . The owner really needs to re - evaluate scheduling and have at least two more servers on the floor  a bartender  and three more people in the kitchen in order for Waterfalls Indian Tapas Bar & Grill to run smoothly.

It seemed the amount of take outs that were being prepared were holding up the dishes coming to our table. Also Barbara ordered a Pashwari Naan and received a buttered naan Barbara pointed this out and The waiter sauntered off to order a Pashwari Naan  by the time a Pashwari Naan came Barbara would  eaten everything and was full.", "name": "Barbara"}, {"review_id": "r-LSWKasuy79GFTveBXd31hQ", "user_id": "u-U3Y7xT8KZwQilb__FGHeIQ", "date": "2015-08-26 05:47:21", "rating": 4.0, "text": "July First of all  Porruthai m not Indian and do not  eat Indian food often. Anyway  Porruthai really enjoyed the dinner here. Do not  get July wrong. Porruthai m Asian and Porruthai like Indian food  especially all the herb and spices !

If it was not  July's husband who wanted to be spontaneous haha : D Sounds funny right ! Porruthai came far away from home. Almost    kms. just to do laundry. Our comforter does not  fit in our washing machine   -  -   . Anyway Porruthai like to take a walk and have a dinner while Porruthai are  waiting for our laundry as Porruthai always do once a month. Is not  it an interesting activity for a couple   : Ok. Come back to Delhi Bistro  Porruthai ordered  BUTTER CHICKEN     . and MADRAS CURRY with FISH fillets     . They did not  come with any bread or rice so Porruthai also ordered Garlic NAAN    . and Rice PULAO    .   . The food was terrific ! Porruthai loved The food so much. BUTTER CHICKEN was creamy and sour. MADRAS CURRY with FISH fillets was filled up with a ton of fish fillets. The waiter recommended MADRAS CURRY with FISH fillets if Porruthai wanted to have fish. The waiter said Madras normally was spicy and went well with fish. Porruthai listened to The waiter  : and Porruthai like MADRAS CURRY with FISH fillets. Anyway for Porruthai's taste MADRAS CURRY with FISH fillets was not  that spicy. The waiter noticed and offered to bring Porruthai chopped fresh chilli on the side. Thank The waiter for caring. Delhi Bistro was a small to medium size. Delhi Bistro have an opened kitchen that you can see what Delhi Bistro are  doing inside. There were not many customers when Porruthai were there but Porruthai believe that Delhi Bistro have regular customers here.

My friend and Sherry's entrees came with a side of rice and a complementary flatbread appetizer served with tamarind sauce and two types of chutney  onion and cilantro .

Sherry really enjoyed the creamy tomato base  and Sherry was glad that Sherry ordered the chicken tikka masala  mild mild instead of medium because the fish curry  medium was REALLY spicy. Sherry was a huge fan of the battered catfish cooked in a garlic ginger sauce but Sherry could only take so much heat. :     Service was impeccable. My friend and Sherry's water glasses were always filled quickly and plates were cleared off the table as soon as Sherry were done with plates. The staff continually circulated by to see how Sherry were enjoying the meal and seemed genuinely interested in any feedback Sherry had about My friend and Sherry's dining experience. Just an FYI the online menu is a little outdated. Sherry wanted to order the chana masala but the chana masala was not  an option on the restaurant menu.

Once for a lunchtime buffet  which was spectacular  and most recently for a quiet dinner for my companion and Jenny. Jenny would give Maharaja Restaurant five stars if it were not  for the quirky service. As is the case with most establishments in Madison Jenny have  noticed lately  the quirky service is often mediocre  inconsistent  or just downright bad. Unfortunately  in this instance Maharaja Restaurant was no exception. Jenny's dining partner and Jenny were promptly greeted by a waiter at My dining partner and Jenny's table. Being that the menu is quite extensive and wanting plenty of time to pour over the menu  Jenny indicated Jenny's indecision and told My dining partner and Jenny's server that Jenny were not  in any rush. Jenny must have  taken that to mean to disappear for the next    minutes. During the next    minutes  Jenny's companion and Jenny decided on an appetizer and Jenny had some questions. Feeling like Jenny were stranded on an island  Jenny closed Jenny's menu a couple times as a lifeline signal. That did not  work. Frustrated  Jenny finally flagged someone over. Jenny was irritated that Jenny could have  spent all those wasted minutes noshing while pondering Jenny's meal selection. After a bit of a communication issue over the menu  Jenny each put in my companion and Jenny's individual dinner orders. Jenny's companion relayed the drink choice :  chardonnay  plus a Coke for My dining partner. Seeming confused  a waiter attempted to clarify. Jenny interjected with a chuckle well  not in the same glass of course   referring to the soda and wine. Moments later  a waiter returned with a wine for Jenny and what appeared to be a watery - Coke for My dining partner. It was obvious after the first sip :  the soda and wine were indeed combined. Ummmm did this just happen   !  ! Again a waiter remained MIA. Finally a waiter returned with Jenny's companion  entree. But not Jenny. About a third of the way into My dining partner's meal  Jenny's dinner finally arrived. Sorry but that is just not acceptable. There was no apology and no indication of the extended wait time. my companion and Jenny's service throughout HIS meal was spotty  with intervals of more frequent attention and drink refills. It is important to note that Jenny showed up just as Maharaja Restaurant opened at  pm so Maharaja Restaurant was not busy at all until a bit later into my companion and Jenny's meal.

Cafe Krishna has been open for a while and has still failed to supply guests with a menu that marks what items are suitable for vegans. At vegetarian restaurants  a menu that marks what is vegan is not just a convenience  a menu that marks what is vegan is a standard. Cafe Krishna stands virtually alone in the Phoenix as the only vegetarian restaurant that fails to offer vegans. This would not  be an issue if servers were more willing to ensure that products were dairy free. Getting a confirmation that a menu items are dairy - free from servers feels like pulling teeth  and Sanjith making people  lives more difficult makes Sanjith feel uncomfortable. Sanjith just want to sit down and eat with no worries. A simple  V  next to all the vegan items would make Sanjith feel more inclined to eat at Cafe Krishna A simple  V  next to all the vegan items would make Sanjith feel more certain about what Sanjith was eating  and A simple  V  next to all the vegan items would make the lives for servers easier not having to run back and forth the kitchen every time Sanjith  and every other vegan  have a question about dairy in Sanjith's food. That aside  the food at Cafe Krishna can be quite good. Sanjith have  had crispy  spicy gobi manchurian here and Sanjith have  had mild  crumbly gobi manchurian. The rasam and sambar is always good. And the dosas are usually a pretty safe bet. Sanjith had Sanjith's first experience with uttapam here and uttapam was quite good but Sanjith will  be sure to ask for no raita next time !

Jeff usually eat dosa and South Indian fare at Woodlands  Ray and Rural . Jeff tried Cafe Krishna for a change. Jeff was disappointed. The service was lousy. The waitstaff was not rude and in fact The waitstaff were very friendly but the wait was too long. Jeff ordered an appetizer and two dosas. The waitstaff took a    minutes to bring us our appetizer and another    minutes    hour  before Jeff got our dosa. Cafe Krishna was not busy when Jeff ordered. There were only   couples in Cafe Krishna at the time and only   couples had   waiters. waiters never checked on us and Jeff had to flag waiters down to get our bill. One of waiters is an Eastern European woman who spoke no English and had never waited tables before. One of the waiters brought our chaat to our table and did not  even bring plates with our chaat. The food itself was good but not noteworthy. Cafe Krishna's chutneys were not tasty or flavorful. The coconut chutney at Woodlands  Ray and Rural is a lot better. our dosa had very little sabji  potato  filling and was nearly entirely just one large crepe. The dosa at Woodlands  Ray and Rural includes much more sabji. Jeff did like the sabji and thought the sabji was better than Woodlands  Ray and Rural because the sabji was slightly less greasy. The samosa chaat was not good. The samosa chaat had very little samosa maybe two small pieces of one samosa   and the rest of The samosa chaat included vegetables. The samosa chaat was not  bad but neither was The samosa chaat tasty. The only positive aspect to Cafe Krishna was Cafe Krishna is  ambience. Despite Cafe Krishna's  cafe  name  Cafe Krishna is a sit - down restaurant. Cafe Krishna  nicer than many full fledged Indian restaurants in the valley. Cafe Krishna was clean  spacious with many booths. and decorated well. You are seated  given a menu and a waiter takes your order. Cafe Krishna  not like Woodlands in which you order at the register. Cafe Krishna has a full menu but Cafe Krishna is  vegetarian. Cafe Krishna  also a South Indian place so Jeff would not  recommend ordering saag paneer and North Indian dishes because South Indians do not  know how to cook North Indian food. Jeff will not come back because the service was too slow. Even when Jeff flagged our waiter for our bill  there was another couple who had sat for    minutes and had not even had another couple who had sat for    minutes and had not even had their drink orders taken's drink orders taken. Honestly  why would Jeff wait an hour to eat Dosa when Jeff can go up the street and eat at Woodlands  Ray and Rural and get the same quality dosa in    minutes. Jeff m pretty forgiving of slow service if the restaurant is super busy or if there is only one server but this was different. You could tell waiters had no previous experience waiting tables and had no sense of urgency. waiters did not  know how to refill drinks  check up on you  bring your bill to you on time. It seemed like waiters were related to the owner or were part owners and tried to be servers. If Cafe Krishna improved Cafe Krishna's speed and service  Jeff would recommend Cafe Krishna.

A regular patron of another traditional  homestyle Indian restaurant down in Georgia La- thought La- should try out the buffet - style Indian meal for lunch that is prevalent with many of these food establishments. The decor was simple yet elegant. Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine was dead; somebody ran to the back to grab the hostess to have my family seated and so there was this odd moment of waiting. However the water was brought out immediately  and La- ordered a sweet lassi drink. a sweet lassi drink was rather delicious; cold  creamy  and not full of ice. La- had to try everything. Mind you  La- went back to the buffet line twice after just to make sure what La- grabbed was not  a bad batch or to verify that the food was indeed that good. Mixed results. the food was uncovered  so the heat retention was not  there and the Sterno cans could not maintain proper heat distribution. Scary thought of food - borne illness. La- dove in anyway; trying to get the pieces closer to the bottom of the pan whilst crossing my fingers. The basmati rice was great and La- grabbed small portions of each entree to sample and stir up the taste buds. Lets narrow down to what La- like and did not  like. Here are my personal downs : the salad was slightly browning and the cucumbers were sliced rather thick than La- would have preferred  nor did the raita yoghurt dressing helped much with flavor in a bland salad. The daal makahni  black lentils with herbs and spices La- could not  care for much  though others may find The daal makahni  black lentils with herbs and spices to others's liking. La- can not  remember how the aloo saag  spinach and potatoes  tasted  but the aloo saag  spinach and potatoes is  another one of those dishes La- can pass on since the mushy texture of spinach did not  jibe with my appetite. The naan flatbread was a little more than crispy for me  however the tender baked portions were just fantastic ! La- fancied the onion pakora  onion fritters   chana masala  garbanzo beans with herbs and spices navaratan korma  mixed vegetables in a cheesy cream sauce chicken chilli  saut ed chicken with onions bell peppers  and tomatoes ... not a fan of spicy foods but this did not  make me break a sweat and was one of my favorite dishes malai wings -  La- want the recipe for this  mint chutney  ! and tamarind chutney  !  . The chutneys were not overbearing in flavor and La- could not  help but to swipe the tasty wings in The chutneys with every bite. Had a small helping of the gulab jamun  milk balls in sugar syrup  which tasted like doughnut holes bathed in diabetes. The kheer was a delightful sweet rice pudding to end the meal with. Cheap eats  great variety of food  local  ambient music  clean interior. The basement bathroom could use a little spiffying and The basement bathroom ran ice cold water. Service was excellent  and as Service should be since there were only two other tables by the time La- finished our meal. La- will have to come back for dinner next time when La- m back in town. Oh  and that gentleman in the back corner staring at my table : please do not ; it is rude and downright creepy. Would La- come back Yes.", "name": "La-"}, {"review_id": "r-ec011igMO5h8ZyrLZhTlGA", "user_id": "u-6AA1GvMABY54hfHBEoaJoA", "date": "2012-10-18 13:54:37", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Food is   - star quality.

Kristina stuck with what Kristina know :  Chicken Vindaloo Extremely spicy     . plain Naan bread    . for a generous portion  and Kheer for dessert  which is Basmati rice cooked in sweetened milk    . . Let me tell you  Chicken Vindaloo IS spicy. You will need naan for this. Wow... the rice was cooked perfectly. There was plenty of chicken and potatoes in the dish. Very filling. naan was PERFECT  AMAZING  and absolutely wonderful. They make their food to order so you will always have fresh food. dessert  which is Basmati rice cooked in sweetened milk reminds me of and old fashioned dessert  or grits. dessert  which is Basmati rice cooked in sweetened milk  quite addicting actually. Kristina had take out. The containers are reusable  microwave and dishwasher safe  for those of us who like to recycle. So that is  a plus. Kristina's order took    minutes. Which is awesome for made to order food. The staff was very friendly. Kristina met the head chef owner who came out when Kristina was placing Kristina's order. These people had smiles on These people's faces  and not fake ones. These people really seem to want to serve you this food and proudly These people will do so. Went back today for lunch. Again  had takeout. Kristina will try the   . All You Can Eat Lunch Buffet and will report on that next time Kristina go over. Anyways  today Kristina had the Shahi Paneer     . - Cubes of homemade cheese cooked in a creamy tomato sauce with herbs and spices  garnished with nuts and raisins   - OMG what a dish. You can have the Shahi Paneer really spicy or just medium spicy. Kristina choose medium. Once again  rice cooked perfectly. a creamy tomato sauce is amazing and the cheese cubes melt in your mouth. Kristina also ordered Pashwary Naan  Bread stuffed with nuts  raisins and coconut  -    . -  Simply delicious and filling. This is a great little meal in itself. Nutty  flavorful  and warm. This Naan they make is the best Kristina have ever had. When Kristina called to place Kristina's order today  the girl remembered Kristina from Last night and was genuinely happy Kristina was coming back. Once over there  the owner chef came out and told Kristina the owner chef's name  Kristina Kristina sorry Kristina forget  Kristina want to say Rishi or something  and thanked Kristina for returning.

And then you can not  see a thing because almost no light gets into The lone toilet stall. The toilet paper is on a weird stick that falls on the floor and lands in... whatever it is that ends up on mens  room floors next to a toilet. So do yourself a favor do not  use The toilet paper. All of which might be tolerable except the light is on a very short timer  with a sensor that does not  reach into The lone toilet stall. So you WILL be left in the dark. And no gesture or flailing above below the divider will trigger the light. So you have  got to try to get yourself out of The lone toilet stall completely blind. A job for Houdini. Houdini m not docking a star  because M. avoid all restaurant bathrooms anyway  and M. m really more interested in the incoming food  not the outgoing.

Big visited them today  though a weekend they were not busy at all. tables max at any time. The first rude frown you get when you mention that you have a Groupon voucher. You are  looked at indifferently and with no sense of welcome. Attitudes change instantly. Once you get to a table  within minutes you start feeling stuffy. No AC  with temps over    degrees outside -  are you kidding me. Requesting them to turn it on met with another frown and no  they did not turn it on. Now comes the worse part  -  THE FOOD. Stale  spoilt  bland and spicy. And for a good    minutes they did not replace two of their   main dishes and the dessert. Along with myself  many other diners gave up waiting for the butter chicken and goat curry to arrive. The  Big do not  care  attitude was quite visible in everything. The vegetables were old and recycled at least a few times with an after taste. Reminded  the manager who not only gave you a cold shoulder but was also getting agitated.

A few friends and Amber came after hitting some bars at midnight to grab a bite to eat and have some beers. The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady  came over and Amber asked about A few friends's beers  - The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady promptly turned a drink menu to A few friends and Amber. Then Amber asked about the shooters A few friends had and The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady rudely said  uh like all of them . Okay. Amber think part of your job should be to know at least a few of the shooters they had to recommend to customers. It was apparent Amber did not  want to be there. Later on  the bill came to     so Amber's friends put down two twentys and the ten dollar bill. The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady came over and said  A few friends need change   and Amber did not. Amber did not want Amber's friends to pay for Amber but Amber only had a     bill with Amber. The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady saw that Amber wanted to pay for Amber's own meal so The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady came over to Amber and quickly said  Amber's meal was      if Amber give Amber two twentys  from the pile  and take Amber's fifty then Amber have paid for Amber's meal . Amber  being a bit buzzed and tired said  Sure and then The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady quickly took Amber's fifty AND the ten dollar bill. Right away Amber's friend realized You know Amber tipped my friend's     for shitty service right Amber was appalled  -  it felt like The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady manipulated Amber in order to get     more tip. Amber would be ok with tipping     IF The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady was friendly and actually made it seem like The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady wanted to be there but The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady did not . The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady did not  come back with the change. Amber hate being played so Amber asked the other waitress there if Amber could have the change back and Amber would leave the tip on the table. Amber then watched as The waitress a stubby Caucasian lady talked to A few friends and Amber's waitress in the corner clearly throwing shade and talking shit about A few friends and Amber. And boy  did The waitress a stubby Caucasian lady take The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady's time getting the change. Amber's friends were  too prideful  to stay and wait for the change but Amber m quite sure The waitress  a stubby Caucasian lady had no intention of bringing the change to A few friends and Amber. Amber use to work as a waitress and Amber NEVER would assume that Amber could keep the change nor would Amber ever manipulate customers to tip Amber more. The next day Amber called and explained the situation to a worker there and a worker there took Amber's name and number and said a worker there would call back later  -  a worker there never did. Obviously  a     loss is not  a big deal at all  even though Amber am a poor student . However  Amber do not  like how Amber manipulated the situation and took advantage of customers.

Oh god it is  so tough to review The Red Room. Where to begin THE WONDERFUL :    -  Choice. Seriously. The Red Room has everything. You can come here for breakfast. You can come here for brunch. You can come here for lunch. You can come here for dinner. You can come here for drinks  finger food  as part of a night on the town. The menu is HUGE. The menu has everything from Pad Thai  to chicken curry  to traditional sandwiches  to pasta  to burgers  to French toast  to poutine and quite literally everything in between. Oh  and there is  a wide range of teas coffees juices  beverages  and cocktails. -  The taste ! Everything Izzy have  tried here  and Izzy have  tried a lot  -  most of the above listed dishes and drinks in fact  has tasted great. Full of flavour  everything in balance  mostly mouth - watering. Why am Izzy writing this review just before lunch Mhmm....    -  Value. The Red Room is as cheap as you would  get in Toronto. Izzy discovered The Red Room the first morning Izzy arrived in Toronto on Izzy's visa  and ate there religiously for Izzy's first few weeks while searching for a job and an apartment. Izzy would have starved if it were not  for The Red Room ! Even when Izzy got a job and moved out to the east end Izzy still continued to return  as the portion sizes are GINORMOUS  and will keep you full all day. Not only are The Red Room's base prices well below the city average  additional deals are offered on some parts of the menu e.g. :  soup and sandwich for  . or something add on coffee to breakfast for just  . etc etc. -  Layout. The Red Room manages to be cosy  yet also inviting to large groups  with most tables offering long benches as seating. D cor is mostly Asian  with a trendy  modern twist. There  an outdoor patio for those summer scorchers. If choice  taste  value and layout are all you value in a restaurant  then stop reading and consider The Red Room a five - star establishment. THE BAD : -  The service is overall  quite bad. Slow and unfriendly. Izzy had the experience of our waiter not believing Izzy were tipping enough  so our waiter just took our money and kept the residual change without even asking if Izzy wanted any money back. This was after our waiter began to know Izzy's boyfriend and Izzy as regulars so our waiter's actions made us feel as though Izzy were stingy and not tipping enough  even though Izzy were leaving moderate tips for the service encountered . THE HORRIFYING : -  Izzy can cope  easily  with the poor service but Izzy cannot accept poor hygiene standards. Unfortunately  Izzy read a recent report stating that The Red Room failed a hygiene and safety inspection  -  one minor infraction  four significant infractions. Izzy can turn a blind eye to many things  but not to food safety and hygiene standards. For this reason alone  Izzy will not return to The Red Room.

The first Brittany went Brittany got the grilled vegetable sandwich and soup. the grilled vegetable sandwich and soup was decently good. Better than what Brittany make Brittany at home  but still not that special. Brittany probably think the grilled vegetable sandwich and soup tasted better than the grilled vegetable sandwich and soup really did because Brittany believe the two together came to like   . or something ridiculously cheap. The next time Brittany came  Brittany had the French toast. the French toast was pretty bad. It was one of the few times Brittany would have wanted to send the French toast back but our waitress never came to check on us so Brittany could not . All the syrup in the world could not  have fixed the dryness that was the French toast. Brittany went there again two nights ago. It was late  Brittany needed cheap food. Brittany really wanted something sweet and since the French toast was so bad last time  Brittany decided to go with pancakes instead. Again  pancakes were bad. Literally worse than the pre - made pancake mix at the store. Like last time  Brittany would have sent the French toast back  but our waitress never checked on us. Aside from the food The Red Room really caters to specific people. If you want to have a quiet conversation over dinner  do not  go here. If you want to talk very loudly over top of other people talking very loudly  go here. If you want to be able to see your food before you eat your food do not  go here. If you want to eat in darkness  go here  just kidding but it is really dark here . The waiters are friendly  but The waiters never check on you. So if you want a refill  good luck. Also  the bathrooms are disgusting. Brittany would really only go back here if it was super late at night the nearby Chinese places were not  open  and or Brittany had very little money on Brittany. As per the alcohol  Brittany do not  drink  but Brittany's boyfriend said my boyfriend's beer was pretty good and my boyfriend had the vermicelli noodles which my boyfriend also said were  OK . his beer was pretty cheap. Brittany think his beer was   . for     pint    . for a pint and Brittany forget how much for a pitcher.

Jessica had always ordered a couple of staples  which were cooked reasonably well and filled the void in my stomach. However and this is a big however Jessica have since lowered a couple of staples  which were cooked reasonably well and filled the void in my stomach to   star. If Jessica could give a couple of staples  which were cooked reasonably well and filled the void in my stomach no stars  Jessica would. Jessica eat here fairly frequently  at least once sometimes twice a month and Jessica do not  even live in Toronto. Last month Jessica ordered the soup and sandwich deal and was told the soup of the day was either tomato chickpea and cream of broccoli. Jessica usually quite enjoy their cream of broccoli soup but what Jessica was served  both taste and texture was more like a wilted old lettuce soup. the soup of the day was disgusting. Jessica kept trying to eat the soup of the day  thinking to Jessica  -  there is  something wrong with the soup of the day. My mother - in - law was the first to pipe up to our waitress about the soup of the day  whom Jessica tried to track down for a good    minutes because no one ever checks on their tables there . There  something wrong with the soup of the day  Jessica tell My mother - in - law. Oh  no there is  nothing wrong with the soup of the day  - the soup of the day is  actually asparagus soup and Jessica just forgot to tell you. Exact words. Not paraphrasing. It was disgusting. Jessica was brought the dreadful tasting tomato chickpea soup instead and just could not  bring Jessica to finish the dreadful tasting tomato chickpea soup. And this is just the beginning because  -  wait -  there is  more. Last week Jessica went in again and decided to order the Phad Thai. Big mistake. Jessica have had the Phad Thai before both there as well as from many other restaurants in the Greater Toronto area and have always quite liked the Phad Thai. the Phad Thai had two pictures of chilli peppers next to the Phad Thai  which most restaurants have despite the Phad Thai being more sweet than the Phad Thai is spicy. Jessica took a bit of the Phad Thai and almost threw up. There was no flavour there  - it was just spice. Jessica complained to the waitress who at first gave me a bit of attitude but said Jessica could order something else. Jessica had a strange feeling so Jessica said  Are the waitress who at first gave me a bit of attitude but said Jessica could order something else planning on charging Jessica for this food Jessica can not  eat  . Of course Jessica am  there is  nothing wrong with this food. Jessica replies haughtily. Jessica tried to explain that this food was beyond hot and that this food was nearly impossible to eat. It  not normally like this. Well that is  not our fault  its Jessica because Jessica did not  read the menu. Jessica was aghast and Jessica even brought the menu over to point out the two chilli peppers. Jessica was beyond being explained to and was at a point where Jessica was arguing with me  not letting me speak and telling me that it was my fault. Jessica kept telling me Jessica had to pay for a meal that was inedible even by the poorest of standards so Jessica ended up walking out. Jessica had at one point even asked to speak to the owner or manager. Jessica actually smiled at me  crossed Jessica's arms and said the owner or manager were not  in that day. Jessica said Jessica was in charge and that is  just the way things are. Jessica have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before in my life. Yes  the prices are good and the servings are large  -  but the service is gawd awful to the point where they should be reported to the Better Business Bureau.

There are no peanuts  no cilantro and you get a lemon wedge instead of a lime. On the other hand  -  it is  cheap as can be  huge  hot  and actually quite tasty.

Honestly  though  Copper Modern Indian Cuisine are  just a solid       stars  middle - of - the - road  restaurant  in Todd's opinion. For years  Todd have  heard people singing the praises of Copper  food but Todd could never convince Todd that Todd really wanted to stop in for a bite. Last night  the allure of      bonus points on opentable.com and the excitement of being      points closer to our      gift certificate spurring us on  Ginny and Todd decided to give Copper Modern Indian Cuisine a try. For starters  Todd do not  want a modern take on ethnic food. Todd simply want to eat authentic  or as close to authentic as Todd can get without eating the excretory parts of an animal  ethnic food. If Todd lived in India perhaps a modern take on Indian food would excite Todd's palate. Todd do not live in India  though. Todd live in Charlotte. Unfortunately  ethnic restaurants in smaller cities have to cater to American taste buds in order to stay in business  and Todd believe Copper Modern Indian Cuisine has subscribed to that philosophy. Nouveau Charlotteans do love anything described as  modern    upscale   or  urban so Copper Modern Indian Cuisine could serve Aunt Jemima pancakes smothered in masala and lure a crowd of identically dressed urban dwellers into Copper Modern Indian Cuisine's restaurant with the mere description of  an upscale and modern twist on a traditional pancake. pancakes :      .  .

The servers were attentive  professional and quick to offer a suggestion when asked about The servers's favorite dish. The food was overpriced for the quality.

This is a great passed plate and has tons of different flavors to choose from  -  -  sweet  mild spice  herby. The paneer inside Naan. was wonderful. The whole traditional side of the menu is great. Plenty to choose from and definitely does not  disappoint with the portions served. Benjamin were all thrilled with our entrees and shared plenty with one another. Which goes to show  the pricepoint with the given portion  in my opinion  is rather fair. They brought us so much extra naan rice and there was plenty for all of us to enjoy individually as well as share amongst the table. Three of us made it out under      no alcohol  and Benjamin were stuffed. The menu is definitely a bit pricier than other places in town  -  -  Avg around     person.

Roy dropped almost     all - in for dinner but the food was so good Roy thought the food was worth every dollar. It was a classic case of getting what you pay for. And the atmosphere  as part of a historic house  was the nicest Roy have ever seen in an Indian restaurant. Since Roy was alone  Roy sat at the small but very nice bar. Roy ordered two glasses of a very tasty Riesling  the Gunpowder prawns  and the  modern  scallop entree both of which appeared to have so many weird ingredients Roy was not  sure how Roy would react to the Gunpowder prawns  and the  modern  scallop entree. Roy need not have worried  since the Gunpowder prawns  and the  modern  scallop entree were among the most delicious of their general type that Roy have had anywhere. Roy also got a serving of garlic naan  which was terrific  though Roy took most of garlic naan home with the amazing basmati rice that came also.

Not great if work is strict with you about your lunch break. Finally  the food did come out. Hashani's favorite was the saag paneer the saag paneer was the most flavorful dish out of all our food. The spinach and paneer were plentiful. Hashani would  get the saag paneer again  but can not  say the same for the other items. Dhal makhani side at     not worth it. Every expensive for the portion you get and Dhal makhani was not as flavorful as Hashani had hoped. Hashani have  gotten better dhal makhani out of smaller less trendy places. The chicken tikka for      Hashani do not  think Hashani would purchase for lunch again. Hashani would  have to stick with takeout dinner on this... The gravy was abnormally very watery and had an underwhelming flavor compared to the takeout Hashani previously ordered. Hashani m guessing Cooper have a big pot of gravy premade and then add protein veggies as needed. Which is totally fine if you can pull of flavor and consistency  neither or these were there today.

My bf and Peg were greeted by a hostess and lead to a table. It was really dark inside ! But the interior was very cute  very romantic and intimate. Peg liked that. And Copper Modern Indian Cuisine was inside a house  which is super cute. Peg would have  given Copper Modern Indian Cuisine two stars but Peg really liked the interior and the food was decent. Peg ordered :   - Tamarind - Curry Leaf Prawns : These little guys were tasty ! Peg really loved the sweetness of the chutney and the contrast with the tamarind. It was a little confusing at first  because Peg m used to eating tamarind in Vietnamese dishes  and tamarind is  used a little differently but Peg thought the flavors paired well overall. - Seafood MelJol  : Peg thought the scallops in The dish were a little undercooked. The dish also got boring pretty quickly. Copper Modern Indian Cuisine gave Peg like four or five scallops  which is generous of them but the flavors were not something that stood out to Peg. But  overall  a good dish. - Chocolate cake :  Chocolate cake was Copper Modern Indian Cuisine's  house  chocolate cake. Chocolate cake was kind of dry... And also not as chocolatey as Peg would have  liked. Peg honestly do not  remember what Peg's bf ordered  and nothing on the RW  website menu strikes a chord so hopefully what Peg did review is enough ! Also  our waiter was pretty terrible. our waiter seemed really young and inexperience. Peg's bf was asking about the Indian dessert option Copper Modern Indian Cuisine had on the menu Peg believe the Indian dessert option they had on the menu was halwa    and instead of explaining what the Indian dessert option they had on the menu was  our waiter just kept repeating   the Indian dessert option they had on the menu  like halwa. the Indian dessert option they had on the menu  like.. um  halwa.

For instance the Malai Kofta  which tends to be a very popular dish  tasted like the Malai Kofta  which tends to be a very popular dish was at least week old. And the palak paneer also seems to be made with canned spinach or something of that like. A do not like the Samosas either  which do not have the right melody of spicy  there is just something off. Oh and just skip the pakoras which have no substance at all  and the aloo tikis are not made properly either  the aloo tikis are way too dry. And also if you try the chana bhatura  chickpeas with fried bread   beware that the chana bhatura  chickpeas with fried bread are not very good  the chana bhatura  chickpeas with fried bread are over masala - d or something and they put a ton of greasy carrot pickle on top. The Indian sweets are decent  but A m not a fan so there is no motivation for A to come here.

Now do not  get Harrisimo wrong the rice and the rice's even sexier sibling coconut rice is just fine here  but the freshly made paratha bread straight out of the over is at the top of Harrisimo's list as the best wrap bread Harrisimo have ever tasted. the freshly made paratha bread straight out of the over  rich in flavour and infuses palatable elements of other delectable flat breads like nan into a stretchy  chewy masterpiece which surrounds your choice of sumptuous fillings like butter chicken or various vegetable masala  in what quickly becomes a textural delight upon completion. To top it off every paratha wrap is served with very fresh standard veg like salad and tomato  and some unique options like spicy marinated carrots and your choice of a variety of amazing sauces like tamarind and hot sauce. Last but not least  it is  very important to mention the absolutely gargantuan size of each paratha wrap which  to put the massive paratha wrap in ethereal terms  is roughly the size of a medium human head and feels like the massive paratha wrap weighs a good kg and a half. Thankfully  the massive paratha wrap does not feel that heavy in your stomach because of the massive paratha wrap's wealth of healthy ingredients and the high quality of the ingredients used Also  for those looking to get those looking to get their money  's money  worth the massive paratha wrap is often large enough to be divided into   separate meals if you are not exceptionally hungry. Harrisimo would recommend the Caribbean Chicken if you are looking for something with meat and the potato curry if you are looking for something vegetarian. Harrisimo almost exclusively get the potato curry because Harrisimo think the potato curry is  not only the best tasting and most filling option on the menu  but the potato curry also happens to be the cheapest at   .  . C mon where else in Toronto are you going to get a massively healthy and tasty wrap for   bucks tax included Answer :  Eastern Twist", "name": "Harrisimo"}, {"review_id": "r-NJLG401-dG13jK1d_IvaVg", "user_id": "u-4oqy291FDdAorqkZfrGC8w", "date": "2017-12-20 03:09:50", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Eastern Twist is not  your average take on indian inspired wraps.

Since having relocated out of the Bathurst and St Clair area  there are few things about the old hood that have Eastern Twist feeling sad and nostalgic. The wraps at Eastern Twist are a serious factor. Tracy now live about   min away and Tracy have  gone THAT far to stop in here. What  ! Eastern Twist is a small  independently owned shop  with a name that in Eastern Twist's eyes  does not conjure what it should. Aside from that  the offerings at Eastern Twist have yet failed to disappoint. Granted  as others have pointed out  previous staffing have proved the experience less than rich however  Tracy will  note that upon recent visits  no sign if pouty pants or the bizarre one who kept calling Eastern Twist  Helen   even after correcting her  were seen. In fact  Tracy did like the young lady who assembled Eastern Twist's meal. Now  aside from all that  the food here is really great. A bit in the pricier side compared to the adjoining food stops  but  Eastern Twist is far more interesting  tasty  and independent. So  there. The BBQ chicken wrap comes in a giant portion  rolled up in a slightly chewy  soft paratha wrap  either white or whole wheat. The chicken is fresh  cooked to order  ANC mighty good. Add in some handsome offerings of lettuce coriander some achar spicy pickled veg   and hot sauce and you are off to enjoy. Other great dishes include the butter chicken wrap  potato curry  and zafrani Palau.

Jaipur Grille was almost empty when David arrived on a Friday night  and David were quickly shown to a nice table by the window. Shortly after placing our order  however  a party of three and a baby were seated at the table right next to ours  -  -  despite the fact that there were many  many other empty tables in Jaipur Grille. Now  here  what David have  struggled with. Do David make this review all about our experience next to the table right next to ours  Or do David focus on the food alone David have  decided to go with the former  since the staff felt it was okay to place a small infant at a table right next to another one  despite ample space in Jaipur Grille. David's appetizer the Chicken Ginger Tikka  Chicken breast marinated in lemon juice  crushed ginger garlic  cooked over charcoal was actually pretty good and David did enjoy it quite a bit. It was only after David would  finished eating it that a baby really started to express a baby's displeasure at being out of the house. a baby wailed for a solid half hour  and probably kept going long after David would  left . Nobody at the table right next to ours made any effort to shut a baby up  and in fact  Nobody at the table just started talking louder. the staff not only did not  do anything about this  but basically ignored our table for the rest of our meal. David would have  ordered another alcoholic beverage but nobody asked if David wanted another alcoholic beverage. Worse still  our water stayed empty right up until it was time to pay the bill. David's main was the Shrimp Masala  Tiger shrimp saut ed with peppers   garlic in tomato   onion masala  and David's dessert was the Gulab Jamun  Dumplings cooked in light syrup with saffron   pistachios but because of the absolutely intolerable ambiance  David was forced to wolf the Gulab Jamun  Dumplings cooked in light syrup with saffron   pistachios down in an attempt to get the hell out of there. David should note  however  that the shrimps were not peeled. The laziness of the chef meant that David was forced to spend a few minutes the endeavor to peel each of the shrimps  with the endeavor made all - the - more difficult by the sauce that the shrimps were soaked in. All in all  this was one of the worst  most annoying meals David have  had in a very  very long time. Neither of us enjoyed our meals  since David raced through the entree and dessert portions.

Masha were seated right away inside the clean  simple  dim lighted dining area.

Our server was extremely friendly  chatty and efficient. Our server was very helpful in helping Masha choose what Masha would like Our server noticed Masha was picky . Masha had : Appetizer :  Dahi vada chaat      -  thin crispy lentil dumplings drowned in thick yogurt  mint and tamarind sauce. This dish was semi - sweet  a bit tart and delish !

There were strong notes of cardamom which was not  a big deal but they could have  toned down a bit. Paneer makhani       -  Small tender pieces of cubed cottage cheese drowned in a fenugreek tomato curry sauce and thick butter.

Naan    . -  The naan bread here was fluffly  a bit stretchy  and super fresh. The naan bread here really went well with our mains. Dessert Drinks :  Masha tried the mango mousse     or    which had a thick creamy whipped cream texture bursting with fresh mango flavor without being too sweet. the mango mousse     or    which had a thick creamy whipped cream texture bursting with fresh mango flavor without being too sweet was pretty tiny; the mango mousse     or    which had a thick creamy whipped cream texture bursting with fresh mango flavor without being too sweet could have  been bigger especially for the price. Jaipur Grille had a nice bar menu but Masha opted for the lassi      and masala chai     . the lassi was semi - sweet  chilled and creamy with yogurt  and masala chai was super fresh and hot ! Masha was afraid Jaipur Grille would  give Masha microwaved stuff like other Indian restaurants. Microwaved tea =  poison tea ! Masha highly recommend Jaipur Grille ! The service is amazing  the ambiance is perfect  and the food is cooked well and tasty. Jaipur Grille's portions are good and the prices are a bit high compared to other places but Jaipur Grille do Jaipur Grille's stuff well here.

Everyone else did the same. some tikka masala my go to was inedible. At least   of the other dishes were just the same  the only flavor was salt. Overpowering loads of salt. And on top of that they had the heater on the lunch buffet set really low or even off  if the food itself had been any cooler Chris would not  have even tried the food itself  for sanitary reasons. One of the managers stopped by to ask  how the food itself was at one point  and Chris was honest with One of the managers. One of the managers did offer to have a batch of  low sodium tikka misala made up  which came out piping hot. And while it certainly was not  the salt bomb that the stuff on the lunch buffet was it was completely bland. It seems a strange turn around from the  was not  salty enough  comment here from   months ago. And Chris know the business is still new but you would  think the business would  have the recipes in tip top shape after   -   months.", "name": "Chris"}, {"review_id": "r-CYE-anKxzbyya3BbyWrZew", "user_id": "u-lLop934D-J7epA6pXUZ3Jw", "date": "2016-07-19 00:10:33", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Good authentic Indian food..

Eating at the lunch buffet James got to try a good variety of things and all of it was pretty darn tasty. James was let down by the chai tea there was not very much flavor in The chai at all. Sadly The chai was more brown water than anything else. Did not  get any other drinks so James can not  speak for them the rest may be good. The atmosphere of Tandoori House is not  enjoyable currently  though this is mainly due to remodeling they are  doing James think. There  not really any decorations on the walls  so apart from the tables the rooms feel empty. But again  they are  currently remodeling so The atmosphere of the restaurant will likely improve over time. The waiter felt very awkward and almost confused. And James do not  think James would  put it to The waiter being new to waiting tables. The waiter had the motions down so to speak but The waiter did not  seem to know what was going on. James asked if James paid at the table now or on the way out  and The waiter did not  seem to know. After a long pause The waiter said it was paid at the table but The waiter sounded very unsure. And throughout our interactions with The waiter  there was never a spark of personality. So comparing Tandoori House to Maharaja  which Tandoori House took the place of. Is the food better Maybe some of the food yeah. the food  the same if not better. The chai is worse  though the rest of the drinks may still be good. The atmosphere currently is a far cry from Maharaja  which it took the place of. Empty walls and lack of any decorations make Tandoori House feel unenjoyable and less fun. Tandoori House lacks the charm that Maharaja  which it took the place of had. And James can only speak for The waiter  but comparing The waiter to the waiters of Maharaja  which it took the place of  there is  no contest. The waiters of Maharaja  which it took the place of had fun personalities and were nice and very attentive  even at the lunch buffet where the waiters of Maharaja are  needed much less. The waiter James had seemed like The waiter would  rather be anywhere else. The three stars are because the atmosphere  and staff will likely improve over time. And the food is already good. Tandoori House has the makings of a great restaurant that will stand on Tandoori House's own and not need to be compared to Tandoori House's predecessor.

Fast forward    minutes..... Express Indien is still completely empty. No sign of one man in the restaurant who was busy on the phone. Leesa-Catherine wait. one man in the restaurant who was busy on the phone finally shows up with the food in bags.       . for lunch which Leesa-Catherine take home. The food.....VERY small portions. Soup was just ok. Everything tasted the exact same  which Leesa-Catherine found so strange. Leesa-Catherine never received seekh kebab but Leesa-Catherine did not  want to go back so Leesa-Catherine just took it as a loss. Vegetables were a mix of fresh and frozen cooked together. Shrimp was frozen so was the meat -  they defrost the meat in warm sauce once an order comes in. Onion bhaji was greasy and mostly batter. The one high spot was the naan bread  -  the naan bread was very good. Leesa-Catherine are  huge fans of Indian food and being in NDG Leesa-Catherine are spoiled for choice. Leesa-Catherine wo not  choose Express Indien again. Leesa-Catherine will  stick with Maison India or Ganges on Sherbrooke.", "name": "Leesa-Catherine"}, {"review_id": "r-jFPUUAdcBFNmnZUOJxeNKA", "user_id": "u-b6i_SOxMPsD06glfJOclpw", "date": "2014-10-30 21:54:57", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Mattie have  had the best thali of Mattie's life at Express Indien.

Food was good and the quality was good. Probably a   - star had The Tasty Touch been more accommodating. Review : T. was a little hesitant to try Namaste since T. m used to a more traditional setting for Indian food  but since T. m down with Indian food and always like to see vegetarian restaurants survive and thrive  T. gave Namaste a shot. On the positive side  the food had familiar flavors and seemed to be of good quality. No complaints there. The gentleman who took T.'s order was friendly and helpful and the   - ring binder with photos of the food was a nice touch. T. typically order T.'s food Thai Indian  Mexican  etc. at a medium spice rating. Apparently  medium  here is quite a bit hotter than what T. m accustomed to. Keep in mind that this is based on only one visit here  but T. will definitely be trying  mild  next time. One slightly disappointing aspect of T.'s visit came when T. explained that the dish was much spicier than anticipated. T. had eaten about one third of the dish before reaching a point where T. could not  go any farther. It became apparent that The Tasty Touch were not willing to remake the dish  -  -  something that is a pretty standard accommodation when there is  an issue such as this. T. offered a couple of other options  the first couple of which did not  help. Finally some veggie rice was extended and some veggie rice helped to tone things down a little bit. In the end  T. was not  as happy as T. would have been had The Tasty Touch simply offered to cook up another dollar worth of chickpeas for T. but T. will  be back to give it another try.", "name": "T."}, {"review_id": "r-YY-zVwU-YtzAcvN21rQ4JA", "user_id": "u-otnjf1PsH_sLVC13K2KAbg", "date": "2018-07-29 01:35:32", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Billy have  eaten Indian food in Scotland  Australia  England  America  Thailand and elsewhere.

Can be customized for spicy like any restaurant but what makes Restaurant Devi different is that the medium spicy is not so much that you can not  eat but enough so that you get some flavor out of the medium spicy. A little kick if you will. So why is Restaurant Devi   stars In my opinion  Restaurant Devi is the first Indian restaurant in North America to give a good Malai Kebab. So stars is  one star. Everything is made fresh  and the servers are very friendly. Another star. Restaurant Devi have an outside seating as well  and Arnav think the view from there of the streets are just gorgeous. The food is again  very good. Arnav ordered naan  garlic Naan  roti  and onion kulcha which were very good and very fresh. Can be made as crispy as you want. stars now. Arnav also ordered Palak Spinach  chicken medium spicy. Again it is  just enough that you get a good kick and it is  good for those who are not  used to spicy food. A medium spicy Palak Chicken is the way to go. Last Star. The inside is very authentic both French and Indian. The lighting and ambience is perfect at any table  and for those legal to drink  not me at but you maybe  there is a bottle if you want a bottle. Of course Restaurant Devi is Bring Your Own Bottle if you would  like too. Restaurant Devi is a little upscale in my opinion. Arnav am a student so Arnav have to watch it.

Niva got the bill and there is a    charge for rice !  !  ! Not special rice mind you... plain rice. When Niva asked rice or naan Niva never mentioned there was an extra charge. Niva have never been to an asian restaurant where you are served a stew and have to pay extra for rice ! So Niva left a    tip. What does the waitress do  Throw a    tip at Niva !

Was not  very much helpful either when Leah could not  finish it all during Leah's work break and had to take it home... no cover for Leah's food obviously ! Lastly Leah m not sure how usually Indian food is priced. As Leah said it was Leah's first time. But anyway  Leah feel like it was pretty pricey for the amount of food Leah got. Leah paid in total for the chicken tikka and a can of Coke  a little over    . Do not  know if Leah will  go back here. Maybe if Leah m in the area and want some Indian food.

Hangr got lost  filled up on gas  did some dishes and pretty much just lolligagged for about    minutes thereafter. Hangr did find it odd that the dish is in a vacuum sealed package.

Unfortunately  Hangr m that girl that will eat anything  regardless how it looks. Hangr was extremely happy to find the meal was fresh made and sooo yummy. Hangr got mild but am thinking the next time Hangr go Hangr will  get medium. There are plenty of paneer chunks too. The naan bread is bigger than Hangr's head. Hangr have  been eating for about    minutes and am stuffed. Looking at Hangr's plate  Hangr have  eaten exactly half the portion they gave which is remarkable since Hangr am a bottomless pit.

Like  smelled like maggots and garbage - juice off. Joei spent     for the royal platter and   beef samosas and almost all of the meats smelled tasted like almost all of the meats were starting to turn. It  important to point out that when Joei came to Bombay's Chutney  they had mentioned that they just got power back because the winds yesterday were intense enough to cut the power in a few places. Joei m not sure how long they were without power but Joei suppose this could be a potential explanation as to why all of the meats were smelling.... sour. Joei m very disappointed that anyone could serve the shrimp that Joei smelled and if the people running the kitchen can not  tell the difference between good meat and bad meat then the people running the kitchen should not  be running a restaurant because the people running the kitchen are  going to kill someone. It felt like Joei was living an episode of Gordon Ramsay  Kitchen Nightmares. Ignoring all that  if this was a freak accident and the food is normally the quality that Joei remember from before  the food is  still definitely not worth the now jacked - up prices they have  implemented.

John had samosas and samosas were freshly made  crispy on the outside and tender inside with a little spice. John tried the szechuan chicken  basically fried chicken pieces with onion  green peppers and hot peppers which again were freshly made  crispy outside and tender inside. John was looking for palak paneer  cheese in creamy spinach which they call saag paneer  and they were helpful in pointing John to what John was looking for. It was a large portion with tender rice. John also had the garlic naan  which was good but John wished they had cooked the garlic a bit before putting on the bread the garlic came out kind of raw. Regardless it was delicious  including the mango lassi. John like spicy so John asked for some chili sauce which went wonderfully with everything so be sure to ask for some chili sauce which went wonderfully with everything if you like spicy. A bit on the expensive side considering there are paper napkins but the portions were generous enough that John had plenty for a meal of leftovers. All of the servers were friendly and professional  no complaints there. John's one complaint was the music  -  a bit obnoxious and a little loud for John's taste. Overall a very good Indian meal.

So tell The owners up front and The owners make sure your taste buds are not burned. Tamarind Savoring India have some great appetizers. Chicken    is Sunil's dish. Other appetizers are also great and sometime Sunil order too much Other appetizers since everyone has there own preference. If you like hot spicy stuff order   Cut Mirchi . Cut Mirchi are chiilies deep fried in a lentil batter served with onions and lemon. Excellent ! The Rice dishes are also very authetic and one should give it a try for Tamarind Savoring India's biryani items. Biryani is Indian version of paella. Tamarind Savoring India serve pure veg biryani as well. Chicken curries are excellent and Sunil always like dish called Chicken Curry.

With regards to the food Dushyanth had vegetable pakora to start and then had four orders of naan  navaratan korma gobi manchurian  and tandoori chicken. tandoori chicken was well done and Tamarind Savoring India give you a lot of naan. Overall the food is quite flavorful and can make up for the restaurant  bad service. gobi manchurian is a bit spicy for the average person so beware you only get   gobis. navaratan korma is very flavorful and the creamy sauce goes well with naan; however  Dushyanth was a bit disappointed that the amount of vegetables was so minimal. the food seemed to be mostly a cream sauce with scarce green beans and potato here and there.

Ankita had been here before and the first time around the food was amazing ! Everything was fresh and prepared exactly how Ankita had requested so Ankita were excited to be back. Ankita live in Henderson and made the drive here to eat here again. Ankita walked into Angara India Spice Grill around  pm for dinner with Ankita's parents and grandparents. Ankita ordered a very basic dinner of Dal Makhani  Chicken tikka masala  Tandoori chicken  a couple of roti and a garlic naan. It  really hard for us to judge spice levels in some Indian restaurants so Ankita always order medium. When the tandoori chicken arrived the tandoori chicken was bland  and Ankita mean like completely bland to the point where Ankita were drowning the tandoori chicken in mint chutney. Ankita asked our server to change the spice level on our entrees since medium was bland. So food arrived and guess what. food was bland ! Ankita asked our server whether our server had changed the spice level in the kitchen and Ankita did not  quite get a clear answer. Ankita's grandmother tasted the Dal and My grandmother almost spit the Dal back out on My grandmother's plate and stated that the Dal tasted old like the Dal had been reheated and the consistency was off as well. Dal is supposed to be bisque like consistency and the Dal was just this unappetizing blob. The owner happened to be around and Ankita's dad told The owner that the food was terrible. The owner offered no apologies but instead offered to reheat the Dal and make the Dal spicier. Ankita quietly finished our  dinner  and made it very clear to our server that Ankita would not  be back our server did not  seem to care. Ankita's grandfather hated Angara India Spice Grill so much that My grandmother actually said eating off the Dollar Menu at McDonalds would have  been a better dinner. Needless to say Ankita would not  return to Angara India Spice Grill ever again.

Angara India Spice Grill is on Grand Canyon behind McDonalds  next door to Tropical Smooth and two doors from Bite. Buffets is available only during lunch and is only    . person. If you have never had Indian food Angara India Spice Grill is a very good deal and allows you to try all the popular Indian dishes. In fact  Edith recommend trying a little bit of everything. The staff at Angara India Spice Grill is very helpful. If you wanna know about a dish The staff at Angara are more than happy to answer your questions. As you are seated  you are offered two types of naan  plain or garlic. Edith chose plain as Edith had to return to the office  and Edith wanted to be sure Edith could taste the flavors of the other dishes. At the beginning of the buffet Angara India Spice Grill have large sized samosas Edith's all time favorite  Indian pastry filled with potatoes and peas    followed by the vegetarian entrees like Saan paneer Edith's all time favorite Indian vegetarian dish  creamy spinach with cheese cubes lentil and eggplant dishes. Edith m not a hot spicy dish person. In the past  Edith have known saan paneer as a mild dish  but Angara India Spice Grill makes saan paneer spicy that Edith had to eat saan paneer with the naan instead of the rice. Unfortunately  because Edith filled up on the samosa  vegetarian dishes  rice and naan the only meat dish Edith could get to was the chicken tikka. Proof that one can get very full on vegetarian dishes alone. Next time  Edith will  have to start with the meats. Other meat dishes available were chicken tandoori and goat curry.

The restaurant is a long corridor and Vimal find the inner most room might have some warmer tables as the front tables can get cold easily due to the doors proximity. the menu has lots of dishes so take your time to go through the menu. Our waiter was from Nepal and Our waiter was very friendly. Vimal got some Singapore rice noodles and Chow mein. The dishes came in quick and hot. some Singapore rice noodles had a bit too much herbs in some Singapore rice noodles but Vimal's friend really liked some Singapore rice noodles. And Vimal loved Chow mein -  Chow mein was dry and the chicken and shrimp pieces were juicy and fresh. Over all had a great experience at The restaurant  -  defined recommending.

David decided to order a couple of old standbys : Pad Thai Chicken  Shrimp Beef : Though this is far from the worst pad thai David have  ever had  - it does not   at least  taste like it was made with ketchup -  it is  certainly nothing special or worth ordering again. The big problem here is that it is  just so darn sweet; David m not sure which ingredient caused this or if sugar was added separately  but it mostly tasted like a pad thai dessert. The proteins were plentiful and cooked well  and the pasta was not  soggy so the pasta was definitely edible  at least . Chilli Beef :  David chose the gravy option and Chilli Beef : was one of the sauciest dishes David have  eaten in a while. And  like the pad thai  Chilli Beef : is  fine but completely forgettable. The pervasive taste here was basil  oddly enough  and the one - note nature of Chilli Beef : did ensure David got a little sick of Chilli Beef : towards the end. Chilli Beef :  kind of spicy  at least. Urban Hakka needs to step up Urban Hakka's game  because if the quality of the rest of Urban Hakka's food is similar to what David got it is  hard to envision this place lasting much longer within this crowded marketplace  David.e. put a  little  effort into your offerings  guys .", "name": "David"}, {"review_id": "r-VfnXHkSLurNDTQF7fBTFyQ", "user_id": "u-_x19W2kX3DEAjgCBvdUnkA", "date": "2018-09-18 15:14:14", "rating": 5.0, "text": "The restaurant itself is a hidden gem for Hakka lovers !

My only complaint was that Maggie ordered the steak and for     they should have  at least cooked the steak properly. Little over cooked. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. Attentive without being overbearing. The atmosphere is a little weird for being in the middle of Dormont so The atmosphere will  have to grow on us  but Needle and Pin is nicely designed.", "name": "Maggie"}, {"review_id": "r-ASuWPbnU4Z6dkiEnXqsyYg", "user_id": "u-cYg4uN2iw-2TSUNluYZ2gQ", "date": "2018-03-17 17:00:21", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Excellent  creative cocktails and unusual  delicious food.

When Erin got our drinks  the person that brought then was confused about what the person that brought had but they turned out to be right. our drinks were pretty good... Erin had an Aviation and an Aviation tasted right. Erin ordered a second round and by that time it was just us and it still took forever to get My friends and Erin's drinks. The atmosphere was kind of plain. Erin guess Erin was just expecting more from a place that has such a unique concept. The food menu looked really good  but Erin did not  eat.

Located in Brampton  surprise surprise  in a plaza not very noticeable. Ashna luckily got one of the last tables available in Annalakshmi. The servers were very friendly  which was the first thing Ashna noticed. Since Ashna's brother is vegan Ashna was happy to see that Annalakshmi serve a combo consisting of medu vada and dhai idli  but a combo consisting of medu vada and dhai idli was pretty deceiving  or maybe Ashna just read it wrong because what came was a medu vada and idli both soaked in yogurt  rather than a dhai idli and a separate medu vada. a dhai idli was not  very good because a dhai idli was literally a tiny idli drowned in a huge  gigantic  rather  bowl of watery and flavourless yogurt. For mains Ashna got the mysore masala dosa and Ashna's brother got the chilli garlic dosa. Ashna liked that Annalakshmi did not  serve the food within a minute  which is what Guru Lukshmi usually does. the mysore masala dosa  arrived in around   -    minutes. Ashna asked for no oil on Ashna's dosa  since no oil was an option however oil was clearly used. Furthermore  Ashna's dosa was pretty bland. Ashna could not  taste any mysore paste and the mysore masala dosa lacked flavour. Ashna did enjoy Annalakshmi's sambar  though ! the chilli garlic dosa seemed to be fine  since Ashna did not  hear any complaints. while Ashna were eating a waiting queue had formed  which showed that Annalakshmi is doing really well. One thing Ashna did appreciate was that when another customer asked to sit at our table while waiting for another customer's own table my brother kindly gave another customer a seat somewhere on the side and explained that Ashna should get our privacy when eating.

Ahad was introduced to Annalakshmi by a friend who said nothing but good things about Annalakshmi admittedly Ahad was a little hesitant at first but Ahad was glad Ahad went for Annalakshmi. Annalakshmi has a decently sized Dosa menu consisting of different variants of Dosa to appease each pallet. Ahad went for the Madras Dosa which was quite amazing it had robust flavours and tasted quite spicy ! As an accompaniment Ahad had the Onion and Chilli Bajjis which were slightly oily but still tasted good. You also have the option to customize how your Dosa is made  less oil  more oil  extra crispy  etc. . That is something to note if you like your food a certain way. Service is always great here the staff always greets you with a smile and are very courteous; something generally not found in smaller ethnic restaurants from Ahad's experience.

Ahmed were not disappointed. Ahmed am a bit of an amateur chef Ahmed and consider Ahmed's palate to be fairly sophisticated when it comes to all kinds of South Asian cuisine. This is not authentic Indian food -  Ahmed do not  have rice and salad bowls  - but it is good wholesome  high quality Indian food. Ahmed ordered a bowl of rice  yellow daal and the koftas  meatballs . rice  yellow daal was perfect  the way rice yellow daal should be cooked. the koftas  meatballs were a little bland for Ahmed's taste  but otherwise not bad... soft and the right texture. Paired with the many sauces and onions and the whole dish was wholesome and rich and very filling. Ahmed's friend ordered the biryani which while not bad  still is not  the way real biryani should be  and Ahmed come from a city known for a city known for its biryani's biryani  - but then Ahmed still have not  found a single place in America that makes biryani the way they do biryani back home. The ambiance is good and there is  plenty of room to sit. The line moves quickly and at most you will  face a    -    min wait on a crowded day. The only issue Ahmed had was with the music  -  being a designer it bothers Ahmed that the music selection to go with such great interiors  could have been better... Ahmed would expect Bollywood classics or Indian classical fusion instead of the usual loud pop music. Tldr :  if you are  looking for authentically prepared and presented Indian food you will  be disappointed. If you are  looking for high quality Indian - American food Choolaah Indian BBQ is a great place to get high quality Indian - American food. Will be coming back to try Choolaah Indian BBQ's tikka masala and chicken next. Update :  went there again with a bunch of friends and tried Choolaah Indian BBQ's chicken tikka masala and pav bhaji.

Brian want to love Choolaah Indian BBQ because the format reminds Brian of Brian's favorite Indian restaurant chain in Austin  -  Tarka. Unfortunately  Brian have  been kind of disappointed in the food and dining experience. Both times Brian went it was totally packed inside. Sure  Choolaah Indian BBQ is new  and people are excited to try Choolaah Indian BBQ. The space is vast  -  well  the vertical space is. Seating space however  is pretty limited and cramped. Some parts are right up against the windows and line  and there is  little room for patrons to move around get toppings  and employees to bus the tables. It is also quite loud. Choolaah Indian BBQ play music that sounds like you are  shopping at an H M. As for food  -  it is not  bad. But also  it really lacks that punch of flavor that Brian have  come to expect and appreciate from Indian food. It really tastes like Choolaah Indian BBQ dialed back the spices and heat to appeal to the midwest palette  and Brian m not very happy about that. Choolaah Indian BBQ do not  offer any spice level when you order  -  but do have some hot sauces in the condiments area. Unfortunately  some hot sauces just are not  the right flavor profile  -  some hot sauces taste more on the tabasco pepper side of the sauce spectrum  and less on the delicious hot curry spice side. It  just not the same. Mango lassi is delicious. Samosa chaat is also quite good. Brian wish Choolaah Indian BBQ did not  use so many disposable plates  cups  plasticware. Another negative compared to my favorite Indian restaurant chain in Austin  -  Tarka. All in all  Brian think Choolaah Indian BBQ is a fine quick alternative to say  Chipotle but if you really want quality and interesting flavors  -  look to one of the old - school restaurants like People  Indian  Tamarind  or All India.

First off the frustrations :  Rich went Sunday afternoon for a late lunch    : ish . The line was long and there were a limited numbers of cashiers. Rich waited in line a good    minutes to order. Rich both agreed that Rich would use order ahead on our next visit. Now here is where Rich's frustration is mixed. Part of the reason The line was moving so slow is that cashiers were guiding customers through the menu in such excruciating depth that orders were taking multiple minutes to put in. One cashier actually brought samples of each masala to a group of four so a group of four could taste before ordering. While Rich appreciate the commitment to customer service and satisfaction this was frustrating to watch. Rich would rather see samples be given in a separate location so customers can make informed decisions before standing in line. Now for the actual food :  On Rich's first visit Rich got the Perfect Balance bowl with Tikka and Lamb. the Perfect Balance bowl with Tikka and Lamb was exceptional. Lamb was perfectly cooked and the sauce was the perfect pairing. On Rich's most recent visit Rich ordered the Choolaah Indian BBQ salad with Salmon. Rich would not  normally order salmon at a fast casual restaurant  but the strength of Rich's first visit encouraged something out of the ordinary. the Choolaah salad with Salmon was quite good  though not as a good as the Perfect Balance bowl with Tikka and Lamb. Note that this is probably due to the fact that Rich rarely if ever  feel fully satisfied after a fish meal. Overall Choolaah Indian BBQ is great. Choolaah Indian BBQ's ordering system is a little slow  definitely consider ordering ahead ! but that can be worked out.", "name": "Rich"}, {"review_id": "r-ES7TOddCM3QnXbn6zGiVtg", "user_id": "u-1ZPnQs-tdvbX8ROjtnzcEg", "date": "2018-02-25 01:47:31", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Toni feel bad giving Coohlaah   stars but Toni think it comes down to the fact that Indian food just is not  Toni's  thing . Toni was excited to come here after seeing a lot of hype on social media about Choolaah Indian BBQ. The best way that Toni could describe Choolaah Indian BBQ is the Chipotle of Indian food. If you are an Indian food lover Toni think Choolaah Indian BBQ would be a must visit ! The atmosphere inside is very trendy and clean. Toni love that you could see inside the kitchen and watch them make the naan -  that was a fun part of dining here ! Choolaah Indian BBQ also huge  with seating downstairs and upstairs so there is enough room to be comfortable with a large crowd. All of the staff here was super friendly and helpful with the menu   provided a nice experience for us. As Toni said before  this was actually Toni's first time eating Indian food so Toni did not  know what to expect. Chris and Toni Chris and Toni ordered the  bowls Chris got the lamb and Toni went with chicken. the  bowls came with rice   the tandoori vegetables as well. You can pick any of the masala sauces to put on top of your bowl Toni chose the only one Toni was familiar with which was the tiki masala. They also had a few sauces to add on the side that were all unique. the masala sauces were the only part of Toni's meal that were actually spicy. Toni also ordered a side of naan that was delicious ! The chicken and the vegetables were both super flavorful -  Toni think it was the tiki masala sauce that Toni did not  love.

Other dishes Misti tried at the table included the Croq Choolaah Salad with tamarind ginger dressing and the Paneer Choolaah bowl with yellow lentil sauce... both also very good !

Steven mean you could tell they did try to give Guru Lukshmi that sophisticated look  but with the table arrangement it does not  work. First and foremost  Guru Lukshmi is small ! Steven mean really small. So do not  invite a big gang or show up with a party of   . Guru Lukshmi was busy Steven got seated quite promptly. Maybe its just me  but Steven found the seating not comfortable at all. It was like Steven was kinda leaning forward ! The service was excellent  organized mayhem is what Steven would call it. When it looks like everyone is confused and does not  know what is going on Guru Lukshmi still hums along.. and they get your orders right. All that aside the food is what brought Steven here and Steven was not disappointed. Steven absolutely loved the vada sambar  in fact to this day Steven still think about the vada sambar. the vada sambar was very authentic. Since Guru Lukshmi has so many different dosas to choose from  Guru Lukshmi recommended Steven try a bit of each ! So Steven ordered about   dosas and they cut it up for us so that Steven could have one piece of each dosa ! That was simple but it went a long way in Steven giving a thumbs up to Guru Lukshmi !

Pro Tip : Order the   noodles off the menu Jennifer shared   Langman with Lamb    . -  noodles cooked al dente with good bites  -  Love the green beans that not overcooked give good contrast to the noodle  -  spicy pepper and sauce are delicious ! -  portion on the smaller size Jennifer really enjoy Charcoal Kebab House's house made hot sauce which has a really distinguish favours and wondering what is  the ingredients. The waitress just said The waitress is not sure because The waitress did not  make their house made hot sauce which has a really distinguish favours The waitress    Charcoal Kebab House has a really limited menu. Hopefully there will be more interesting items be added and Charcoal Kebab House would improve on Charcoal Kebab House's grilled skewers since Charcoal Kebab House just opened recently ! Maybe Jennifer might come back and try Charcoal Kebab House's Danpanji  Big Plate Chicken with Home made noodle  or Manta  Steamed Lamb Dumplings      . but definitely not in a rush... Pro Tip : There are a lot of other restaurants in the Scarborough area that offers similar items at a much lower price point and taste better...

Most Uyghur are Muslim so the food Charcoal Kebab House serves is Halal. Besides Charcoal Kebab House's signature dish Dapanji  there are   more stuffs Marc would like to strongly encourage foodies to give a shot. One is the cumin - spiced lamb skewer. Another one is the  Naan   made from flour . In general  none of the stuffs Marc have tried there so far disappointed Marc.

Given Charcoal Kebab House's location Eric knew Eric would have to set a side a good day to commute here if Eric wanted to reward Eric's quest with a taste of the intriguing looking cuisine that was significant of to distinct Central Asian nation. But Eric's quest to go there was commenced sooner that Eric had planned when yesterday a dining companion keenly wanted to take a look when Eric mentioned Charcoal Kebab House to a dining companion. And so Eric did just that. Eric were both off to a funny start when Eric unexpectedly discovered that Charcoal Kebab House caters to both Mandarin speaking and non - Mandarin speaking customers when Eric were given menus with Chinese scripts in menus with Chinese scripts in them. Eric both had an amusing moment when trying to figure out what each dish was while also pretending to be academic linguists in the making by trying to decipher the Chinese description. Pretend - time was cut short when Eric decided to ask the waiter if English menus were available  Eric had a brief moment of embarrassment while going to get the respective menus. Most of the items are laid out across on a one page fold - out menu each accompanied with a picture depicting the described dish. There are a few noodle dishes that looked similar to one another with the beds of noodles making the distinguishing the difference a couple of soups and stews and the more familiar kebabs with the turkic style thicker naans. So Eric decided on getting the lamb kebab combo which comes with naan and an iceberg lettuce salad and also a langman noodle plate. The kebabs came out first and having not had lamb in a while taste of the bite size pieces were dainty for Eric and even more so when wrapped in a piece of the naan bread. Eric hope that the owners start serving an Uyghur style salad at some point  an Uyghur style salad would make all the difference compared to the ice - berg salads that are served at other more distinct places. But Eric definitely loved the noodles and what made it really good was the spiced - up gravy from the lamb curry that it was cooked in. Eric kept alternating between the noodles and spoonfuls of the naan bread. The flavor in the spiced - up gravy from the lamb curry that it was cooked in reminded Eric of similar flavors found in some of the curry based noodle dishes in Eric's country so it was really enjoyable to be able to taste something familiar from the langman dish. And if naan bread was also available as a side order Eric would have asked for one to soak up some of the spiced - up gravy from the lamb curry that it was cooked in yes delicious. Alot of the reviewers have mentioned the Dapanji so that what Eric will  have to try next time and maybe some of the other noodle dishes.", "name": "Eric"}, {"review_id": "r-LAi9Bz_KwOcm36IHhUcHKQ", "user_id": "u-OIM0gH6btoQv0IsEHdxajg", "date": "2013-04-20 18:53:55", "rating": 1.0, "text": "Worst restaurant ever  ! !  !

The menu is simple and is presented with pictures. While Suresh waited for Suresh's meal Suresh enjoyed some tea which had to steep for    minutes. Suresh ordered the lamb and chicken skewers as the lamb and chicken skewers are a staple on the menu and came highly recommended. It was good and eating it with the naan is incredible.

One should be aware of what Masala Kitchen is so that one  expectations are realistic. Masala Kitchen have the capacity to do two things very well  -  take out food and catering orders. While Masala Kitchen have a couple of small tables where one may consume freshly made food Masala Kitchen is not a sit down restaurant in the typical sense. . What is also useful to know is while the cuisine is Indian the cuisine has an East African influence and therefore there are some important differences to the usual Norther Indian restaurant food. So for example the samosas have a thinner crispy  triangular wrapping rather than the doughy  thick wrapping associated with Northern India. Masala Kitchen also have fried Muhogo  cassava that you do not find in Typical Indian cuisine. Masala Kitchen make Biryani in two styles  the East African way with the rice and the masala gravy separate or the Lahori style where Biryani is cooked and presented in one vessel. Al had the opportunity to sample various dishes during our two vists there to work out a catering menu for our event. The challenge was to accommodate the significant number of vegetarians among the majority carnivores. The management was very helpful in helping us come up with a good combination of items. Al's biggest problem was in trying to pick a few dishes as so many delightful items are available. Al would highly recommend the Black Kebabs -  fried meatballs essentially  with the right combination of spices. Bet you cannot just eat and stop at one. For vegetarians Masala Kitchen have the spicy potato balls  BatetaVada . Al had Chicken Pakoras that were a huge hit with our guests. The Chicken Biryani is a must. Next visit Al want to try Masala Kitchen's masala fish -  their masala fish looked so appetizing but Al truly was way too stuffed to try one more thing. Our order for     people was ready to be picked up at the appointed time. The portions were overly generous. The management had gone out of The management's way to obtain disposable serving thalis for us  knowing Al were out of town and a pre - wedding Dinner event was in a rented community center hall.

Kal like Kal's butter chicken to have a noticeable tomatoy taste but butter chicken  chicken was more rogan josh sauce. korma  again korma tasted good did not  have much of a coconut taste. dhaal makhani was quite good. veg curry were well spiced and good selection.

One hand Saffron Fine Indian Takeout is  solid food served quickly  friendly staff  and reasonable prices for Indian in the NW side of town. On the other if Cori m craving Indian Saffron Fine Indian Takeout does not  quite satisfy. From someone who loves Indian food and had traveled to India and eaten the real deal -  Saffron Fine Indian Takeout is  not quite to my quality of authentic. For example   the naan is closer to greek pita than Cori would  expect. Not that Cori have an issue with greek pita... but just not always what Cori m hoping for. That being said  there is not  a lot of NW competition for Indian so it is sometimes better than taking a bit of a drive to something a little more authentic or going to a higher price point place that takes a while. Saffron Fine Indian Takeout is a bit different that some restaurants in that Saffron Fine Indian Takeout make a handful of dishes that day and you choose from a handful of dishes  -  not the menu unless you order in advance for a lot of people or something. Saffron Fine Indian Takeout will always have butter chicken and a dahl but other than butter chicken and a dahl you will  have to call or just go check it out. Saffron Fine Indian Takeout will always have a few vegetarian dishes and then some with meat. Saffron Fine Indian Takeout often have ocra and saag which are far from my favourites  -  and that is  sometimes a bit disappointing to me. The good thing about Saffron Fine Indian Takeout is the food is made when you stop in  but does NOT taste like buffet style that is  been sitting  so it is  quick to stop in and pick up. The prices for NW are not bad. For a veggie combo you get veg dish rice  naan and a curry for   . Add a buck for a meat combo. Add a couple bucks for a second veg dish. A combo with   dish is more than enough for me most of the time. A combo with   dishes is usually   meals if Cori buy more naan. Overall that is  not a bad deal when facing the cost of other NW alternatives. Overall   Saffron Fine Indian Takeout is definitely a good option to have around.

It may have taken me a few months to get this new Indian joint on Junction Rd otherwise ! Corey was bouncing around the threads last night saw  this new Indian joint on Junction Rd  and got in the car. Corey called on Corey's way to make sure this new Indian joint on Junction Rd were actually open. Folks this is easily the best Indian food Corey have  found in Madison for three reasons :    . The Menu... holy cow The Menu S HUGE ! Corey went for dinner and spent forever pouring over each and every page  looking up a few items on Corey's phone because a few items were new to Corey. No shortage of variety here. . The Dosas... this and this alone should make you speed over. Corey think this new Indian joint on Junction Rd have    ! That nuts ... NUTS ! Corey m used to seeing maybe   or   different kinds at a place.   . The Flavor... everything Corey tried was incredible. And although spice heat is key to Indian cooking theirs is well balanced  and not so hot that you can not  taste anything. Corey had vegetable jalfrezi chicken tikka masala  masala dosa and garlic naan. All of it was awesome ! GET THESE THINGS ! Even the garlic naan  which Corey sort of feel like is tough to make incredible  but garlic naan was incredible. garlic naan arrived at the table piping hot and aromatic and did not  have an offensive garlic flavor. The chicken tikka masala was some of the best Corey have  had  topping some of the curry Corey long for in London. The veggies were tender yet crisp and in a super tasty sauce. And masala dosa. Ohhhh masala dosa masala dosa was good  not Corey's favorite  but with so many options  Corey can not  wait to get back and try another one... maybe more adventurous than masala dosa. Huge props to the stellar staff that made sure Corey had no questions about The Menu  kept water glasses full  and told us the stellar staff that made sure Corey had no questions about the menu will have beer wine liquor soon. Just wrapping up some paperwork. the stellar staff that made sure Corey had no questions about the menu also sent us home with leftovers in boxes and gave us extra rice. Very kind. The atmosphere ai not  much so do not  go expecting to be transported to India or anything. There is some nice stuff hand painted on one wall  but some nice stuff hand painted on one wall is  about it. Small space. Bright light. No tunes playing the night Corey was there. Corey did not  notice construction dirt or dust so Corey m guessing the stellar staff that made sure Corey had no questions about the menu cleaned up after what sounds like a rushed opening. And my feeling has always been  if Corey m there the first week  Corey m going to make a few exceptions anyway knowing the stellar staff that made sure Corey had no questions about the menu are  still trying to find the stellar staff that made sure Corey had no questions about the menu's footing. These guys have though.

It  really a shame that for a place that serves up very decent  authentic indian cuisine  that the customer service is so deplorable. Monali's parents and Monali went in today to pick up an order of undhia and bhajia at  pm. My parents and Monali had pre - ordered an order of undhia and bhajia and arranged the pick up time. Monali were told to wait for   minutes which Monali did with no problem. minutes turned into         and almost   . When it finally came out Monali's father rightly expressed concern about the timing since Monali were ordering a very large amount for a special event. The owner snidely replied  well  if my father are so concerned then why are Monali even ordering from Bollywood Bites Ummm  say what   First rule of customer service the customer is always right. And even if the customer are obnoxious which Monali were not  Monali APOLOGIZE for being late. And Monali do not  make snide comments. And here  the kicker  Monali let it slide because there were other people in the store  and when Monali got home Monali realized Monali had gotten the WRONG order  Monali had   orders of bhajias. So Monali called The owner  to note this error. Instead of an apology  at this point Monali were owed two  Monali got Monali's adamant denial that Monali was in the wrong. No it was Bollywood Bites who had placed a wrong order. Monali's father expressed my father's disapproval of Monali's behavior and you know what Monali said  Monali do not  have to listen to you  Monali have  opened restaurants before  Monali do not  need to be told how to run it. UM  actually  Monali do. Because Monali are RUDE  UNPROFESSIONAL  and cocky enough to think that just because Monali's food is good Monali can get by with the worst service Monali have ever encountered. This is America you can not  treat your customers like this and get away with it.

Shauna's co - worker is married to an Indian man and is quite familiar with the cuisine Shauna am not   - so My co - worker offered to take a group of a group of us in and help a group of us decide what to get. Be warned :  Bollywood Bites is difficult to find - CL did not  refer to Bollywood Bites as a hidden gem for nothing. If you look on Bollywood Bites's website Bollywood Bites give great directions with a map  making it much easier. Also be warned that if your meal is under     it is cash only. Shauna came with a group of us   and waited for about a half hour for a group of us's meals... it is take - out only so this may not be ideal for a workday lunch unless you work in the vicinity. Bollywood Bites also do not have everything listed on Bollywood Bites's menu on a given day -  so unless you are extremely familiar with Indian fare  -  Shauna recommend going in and talking to My co - worker rather than calling the order in. My co - worker was friendly and helpful. Despite the above warnings  the food the food itself is really beyond delicious and earns the four stars solidly. Shauna's co - worker said the food itself reminded My co - worker of meals cooked in My co - worker's in - laws kitchen. Shauna ordered the paneer tikka masala Which was killer  make sure you get the roti that goes with the roti that goes with it. Shauna also had the Pani Puri  which isnt on Bollywood Bites's menu online . If you have never tried the Pani Puri  which isnt on their menu online  -  get the Pani Puri  which isnt on their menu online now ! So delicious ..make sure you ask how to eat the Pani Puri  which isnt on their menu online though or you will  be lost. Shauna had quite a bit of food for    -  the menu is super affordable.

Cat happened to be driving right past Bollywood Bites today so Cat stopped in to pick up some chaat  just a quick little snack. It is indeed nearly impossible to find Bollywood Bites. Just when you are  about to give up  drive     feet farther and Bollywood Bites is  on your left. The woman in the front was nice and smiled a lot  but understood very little Cat asked so Cat just went with an order of Samosas and an order of Aloo Tiki. The woman in the front told me   No credit card. Cat said fine  that Cat would  brought cash. Cat said Cat would go drop off my order in the kitchen and come ring me up. Cat stood at the counter for five minutes before Cat decided to sit in one of the plastic chairs. Cat realized Cat was not  coming back for awhile. Cat brought out my food about ten minutes later and told me an order of Aloo Tiki would be   . Cat handed Cat a    . Cat went in the back  then came back and asked me if Cat did not  have    exactly. Cat said Cat did not   and asked if Cat would  take a check or something. Lots of miming with my checkbook here. Cat shook Cat's head and made a phone call. Cat spent another   -    minutes waiting while Cat was in the back with my     trying to figure out what to do with my checkbook. Finally Cat came back to the front and went over to the cash register  that had been ignored throughout this whole time. While still on the phone Cat tentatively pressed a button twice and  woosh ! the cash register drawer flew open and Cat's eyes lit up. Yes  Cat had to make a phone call to figure out how to get change for a    . Cat left  amused at how screwy Bollywood Bites was and expecting never to return. Then Cat got home  and Cat tried an order of Aloo Tiki. Here  the deal Aloo Tiki was the most flavorful Aloo Tikki Cat have  ever had in Cat's life. Samosas were incredible. It is quite clear that there is a master in the kitchen at Bollywood Bites. But it is equally clear that the management of Bollywood Bites is horribly inept. Both from the reviews here  and from my own personal experience trying to simply order    worth of food from the management of this little hole - in - the - wall restaurant. Whoever is running the show has made a series of bad decisions and wrong turns. The location is terrible. The lack of tables is ridiculous. Leaving a woman to manage the orders who can not  communicate and does not  know how to open a cash register is laughable. Cat do not  know whether to love Bollywood Bites or hate Bollywood Bites. Cat am absolutely sure Cat will be back to try more of the delicious food but Cat wo not  get too attached to Bollywood Bites.

Maddie thought of checking Bollywood Bites out for lunch since Maddie found out Bollywood Bites is one of the very few  or the only one Maddie know  places in Charlotte that serves Indian Maharashtrian street food  one of the biggest things Maddie miss about India. When Maddie walked in  Bollywood Bites was empty but then the owner heard the door open and came out to take our order. Maddie was having a little tough time explaining all the dishes to Maddie's boyfriend but then the owner gave Maddie a menu that explained most dishes for someone not familiar with Indian terms. Just like someone else said in their reviews Maddie was disappointed when Maddie was not  greeted or did not even get a smile. Maddie tried to ease whatever tension was in the air by discussing some of the food items on a menu that explained most dishes for someone not familiar with Indian terms but it seemed like it was such a big task to get the owner to even talk to Maddie. That being said  the food still gets Bollywood Bites   stars and since Bollywood Bites is  a take out place the lack of smiles does not  bother Maddie that much. Definitely a place to check out if you want to try something more than the usual South Indian or North Indian food. The  bataka vada   which should be  batata  vada  was delicious ! Even writing about The  bataka vada   which should be  batata  vada here is making Maddie drool. Maddie's boyfriend had the paneer kathi rool and Maddie had the Bombay grill sandwich both of which were great. Maddie's masala chai was good too ! Something about the sev puri amused Maddie though. They gave us whole puris  potatoes  noodles and sauces chutneys separately and Maddie had to make the puris  or mix the puris into the end product  Maddie when Maddie got home. Maddie see the reason why they did it  the reason why they did it is to keep the puris from going soggy with the sauces filled in the puris too long but Maddie doubt someone who is not familiar with Indian Maharashtrian street food  one of the biggest things Maddie miss about India would understand what to do with a bunch of puffed up puris and sauces or how to make the sev puri. Maddie you need to tap one side of a puri to make a hole through which you put in just a bit of potatoes  mint chutney tamarind sauce  yogurt and then top a puri with the sev  noodles  and eat a puri in one go ! Maddie hope this helps some confused soul out there in tasting this mouth - watering off - beat cuisine  Update : Make sure the yogurt and chutneys are fresh before you take food home. Maddie once got a bad batch where the yogurt had gone sour and the chutney container was puffed up with mold growing on the surface. Since it was too late to go back Maddie mentioned that to the owner the next time Maddie went there  but the owner did not even so much as apologize for it. That did seem a little rude to Maddie and so Maddie had to knock off one star for service.", "name": "Maddie"}, {"review_id": "r-KV9-Ijzp0otQJZ896_CPXA", "user_id": "u-yfECTGBYb6IarwwNMm6zUA", "date": "2012-09-08 21:44:00", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Bollywood Bites is super DELISH !

Ordered Rotis as well  but opening of package found that Rotis were griddle rotis and not tandoor oven baked as Rotis are Salim's preferred option. Nevertheless Rotis were perfect. Lots of rice  salad and yogurt raita provided as well. As and extra thinks for appetizers Salim picked a few samosas and Paneer pakoras fritters.

William the owner has a great Vegetarian and Non Vegetarian lunch special  perfectly delicious and at a great price. Johan come here once a week for our Indian treat ! This particular visit instead of a great Vegetarian and Non Vegetarian lunch special  perfectly delicious and at a great price Johan wanted to have the Chicken curry again. However Johan wanted the authentic Indian version  not the Westernized cubed chicken breast version. See Johan grew up true Indian food with close family Indian friends and have come to love the Chicken curry. Johan asked William the owner if William the owner could make the chicken curry this way for Johan  surprised by Johan's request William the owner said this way is  how they have the chicken curry at home and this way is  the true way to prepare the chicken curry  however to make the chicken curry more commercially acceptable they make the chicken curry the chicken curry with chicken breast cubed in Paradise India. William the owner was more than happy to prepare the meal for Johan this way and got right to it  and by the looks of it  happy to accommodate Johan's request  even down to the spice level Johan required. While William the owner was whipping up Johan's special request Johan started with a truly delicious hot and spicy crispy crunchy flaky Samosa filled with a curry potato and pea filling appetizer served with a delicious mint sauce and tamarin sauce. James had a great Vegetarian and Non Vegetarian lunch special  perfectly delicious and at a great price  Chicken Tikka Masala Chicken  Korma served with rice. William the owner brought out Johan's chicken curry and my request was absolutely superb ! this way has so much more flavor ! Johan enjoyed my request so much ! Taking Johan back to Johan's aunty Priscilla chicken table    years back. Only when something is truly authentic will it transport you back in time to a childhood kitchen table where one was enjoying the real deal  and take it from Johan  William the owner Indian cuisine is as real as William  Indian cuisine gets !", "name": "Johan"}, {"review_id": "r-YShvlXK8Yemp6kF4JFWTIw", "user_id": "u-owjOkU0v0mchVD-1Ngj4Ig", "date": "2018-08-30 00:12:44", "rating": 3.0, "text": "reasons why Vid m leaving a   star review   or else Vid would have  left a   star. Our server was really nice the tikka Marsala was pretty good. Now the reasons why Vid m rating Paradise India so low. Vid were the only table in Paradise India besides   take outs yesterday night. Our food took almost    min to get to the table. even though the Marsala tasted pretty good the portion was so small there was literally   chopped up pieces of chicken in the    oz bowl which Vid paid    bucks for. Vid ordered the Paradise India special platter that had   little ass pieces of different types of chicken  a little piece of fish     quarter sized pieces of lamb      nickel sized shrimps  which Vid paid    bucks for. None of which had any flavor but Vid managed to eat it because Vid dipped everything in the Marsala sauce while Vid forced Vid to eat. Vid ordered saffron rice which is suppose to be more flavorful but it literally tasted like salty rice. bucks for that. So portions were definitely not worth the price.

In the UK  great Indian restaurants are everywhere  while great Indian restaurants are less common in Arizona. Pati were pleasantly surprised. The menu has standard Indian classics  such as biryani and curries of all types  as well as naan and other breads  and is quite tasty. Pati ordered bhajis as a starter  then my English husband had vindaloo and Pati had chicken biryani. The mint and cucumber sauces were yummy  as were our main dishes. India's Flame also has a buffet if you want to try a variety of dishes  which Pati plan to do for lunch one day. Portion sizes are quite good Pati had leftovers to take home. India's Flame is a decent local spot for an evening dinner. Pati were there on a Friday night while India's Flame was not super busy  India's Flame had a good flow of customers and people ordering takeout. India's Flame  still new and Pati do hope people continue to patronize India's Flame and keep India's Flame open. One thing to keep in mind is that India's Flame's heat scale is    -    . That would be Scottsdale    -      as a medium was actually quite mild and a   was less spicy than Pati's husband expected. Not a problem you can just tell your server you like spicy and your server will adjust the heat to your liking.

The veg options were fairly standard for a North Indian lunch buffet  -  spinach lentils  vegetable korma rice -  but very good versions. The veg options were very low - spice  with some variation b w options like  -  the spinach was super mild  whereas the korma was just hot enough to leave a pleasant heat at the back of the throat.

My only kind of weird and very particular complaint is that Russel chose to sit at a table instead of a booth  b c Russel m a small person w a short torso and Russel often find that the distance b w booth seat and table height is uncomfortable for me  but the chairs for the tables were also kind of high.

With The bubbly hostess's detailed descriptions Colanie decided on.... -  Hot   sour soup with shrimp -  should have gotten chicken because the shrimp were tiny and Colanie did not  like the taste of the shrimp; however Hot   sour soup with shrimp was spicy and flavourful and left a strong afterburn. -  Lung Fung soup  -  if you like egg drop soup you will  like this. Chock - full of veggies  tofu and chicken. -  Chicken Pakora  -  crispy and flavorful on the outside  tender and juicy on the inside. -  Chili Fish  dry  lunch special which comes with a tiny egg roll  bleh rice and soup pop. It was flavorful and the fish was moist. Did not  see any dessert on the menu so Colanie asked The bubbly hostess about any dessert; The bubbly hostess must have notice Colanie's sad face and went to talk to the chef  who happens to be The bubbly hostess's hubby . The bubbly hostess came back and said that the chef  who happens to be her hubby could make us a deep fried pineapple dessert with vanilla ice cream drizzled with maple syrup OH YEAH ! Tried vanilla ice cream drizzled with maple syrup and Colanie did not  like the taste of vanilla ice cream drizzled with maple syrup;  but when Colanie paired vanilla ice cream drizzled with maple syrup with the warm deep fried pineapple and vanilla ice cream drizzled with maple syrup it was delish ! With lunch menu prices at   . nice ambiance  inside   and exemplary service ; Wong's  blew Spicy Dragon out of the water ! It was nice knowing Colanie SD.", "name": "Colanie"}, {"review_id": "r-bguhZUyqDmjb7hgiggEO5g", "user_id": "u-9EJPUru7ORXoCFF033zP7w", "date": "2017-08-01 00:09:55", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Bro and Neil had vegetables fried rice manchurian mix chow mein  chilli chicken with extra gravy and all extra spicy .. food was so good .. gotta comeback soon", "name": "Neil"}, {"review_id": "r-WDQlEUE6SXsnOZAlJCwLhQ", "user_id": "u-WzUVi46q31TaezUCGNYbVw", "date": "2017-07-25 23:31:41", "rating": 4.0, "text": "first time at Wong's  Wong's Asian Cuisine  Wong's Asian Cuisine is Hakka - Chinese cuisine.

What Sam Got :  Chicken Pakora Fish Pakora  Bombay Chicken Chili Fish What Sam Liked :  Bombay Chicken is definitely worth trying. Pakora was delicious What Sam Did not  :  Chicken Pakora was only alright What Sam will  Get Next :  Bombay Chicken and crispy beef a small restaurant is a highlight in an otherwise drabby - looking plaza. The interior looks great and the service is simply outstanding by any standards. On a weekend evening  there was a steady flow of people for takeout and dine in  which made the service even more impressive ! Sam ordered two pakora dishes  chicken and veggie  and two meat dishes  Chili Fish and Bombay Chicken . Pakora came first. Sam will  be honest : chicken was good but not great. chicken missing some kick and Sam think the crunch factor could be higher. HOWEVER... Pakora made up for it :  very tasty and one of the few dishes where Sam would  opt for the non - meat item ! Chili Fish was good  with a very optimal amount of spice for someone who can handle moderate amounts. But the star of the show is Bombay Chicken. Sam think Bombay Chicken is  the preeminent dish to figure out if you like subtle tastes. Bombay Chicken  different from Federick  and Hakka Legend with some savoury flavours that just bring out a special something. Worth trying. Sam got to pretend to be a serious food connoisseur by trying to figure out all the spices and seasonings they used here ! The only downside of a small restaurant is a bit beyond their control. Lots of places have downstairs basement washrooms... But this one was particularly ragged. Clean  for sure  -  but a little old looking.

Shalimar Foods primarily serves north Indian food with tastes that can only be found in roadside restaurants in India. Food is  in other words  on the spicier and slightly greasier than what one would typically find in the Valley. The owner can customize heat levels though. J have tried different dishes but one of J's favorites remains Chicken Curry. Unlike many other places  meat is tender  flavorful  and often oven baked. Curry does not contain cream which is a big plus in J's book. Chicken Tandoori oven - baked chicken  is J's another favorite. Chicken is moist and  unlike many other places  not rubbery.

Chuck were not  disappointed. Chuck ordered chicken tikka masala and chicken tikka. Chuck are those rare people who actually do not  like spicy food but love Indian as long as Indian is  cooked VERY Mild. So Chuck always order super  super mild. It had no heat at all so Chuck nailed it on the first attempt  which almost never happens for Chuck. The flavor was AMAZING. The sauce had an incredibly fresh taste brimming with intense flavors and fresh herbs  so much so Chuck could not  get enough. The sauce not exactly the taste Chuck remember from Chuck's days in California but unlike other Indian restaurants that fall short at imitating the taste Shalimar Foods was just so amazingly unique in taste that Chuck would  put Shalimar Foods on par with the best Chuck have  had  just uniquely different. Since Chuck's favorite Indian place in AZ closed  India  Grill Chuck have  been disappointed over and over trying to find another place. Shalimar Foods will be Chuck's new favorite. Just be aware Shalimar Foods is  really only good for takeout. As others noted  Shalimar Foods is  so tiny and not really outfitted for dine in. Also  Shalimar Foods is  really hard to find because Shalimar Foods is  so tiny. The storefront is only about    feet wide and Shalimar Foods is  tucked between a Chinese restaurant and a nail salon. Chuck drove by twice and did not  spot Shalimar Foods; the owner had to talk Chuck to Shalimar Foods ! And as other  have noted  it is  truly the owner and one other person cooking everything from scratch so it takes longer  over    minutes from the time Chuck ordered . But there is  something really quaint about the whole experience; it is  like you are  visiting the owner and one other person's home and the owner and one other person are  whipping up some home cooking back in the kitchen. Oh  and as noted  prices are very good. Generally about     less than Chuck m accustomed to paying.", "name": "Chuck"}, {"review_id": "r-zbyULYo2wjeVQS4s36QiUQ", "user_id": "u-CTavgBU-A8wQgmvp07FCeg", "date": "2015-05-08 21:11:03", "rating": 4.0, "text": "The food was just wow..

The food was not  super fresh  but certainly still edible. the butter chicken was completely different than the one Nadine had on a Sunday  -  the butter chicken tasted  to me  like the butter chicken was just cooked in a can of tomato soup. The butter paneer was still very good. The dessert  vermicelli kheer  tasted like plain milk with some noodles thrown in  and the jalebi was quite soggy.

Samosa Factory is small  dark and moody with a Portishead soundtrack and a waiter who so professional you assume he must be going to graduate school for philosophy or something. Add to the mix the trippy Ganesha cartoon being projected on the window  and you are  definitely half way to Manhattan. It  a cool sensation  and perhaps one that can only be experienced at a later evening hour. The best part :  unlike Manhattan it is  easy to park ! Go Vegas. As for the food  Misti rarely go out for Indian dinner because Misti find it hard to go without the cornucopia offered by a lunch buffet  which they do not offer . Last night  though  Misti decided on Indian for dinner and this was close. Misti ended up spending      which seemed expensive  but Misti got three entrees when Misti would have been okay with two. The average entree is    . Misti had Baigan Bartha  Paneer Makhani and Dal Makhani. Misti requested a medium spice  and a medium spice was on the lower edge of spicy. Of the three dishes  Paneer Makhani was the absolute best  the perfect balance of tomato and cream and without a trace of grease. They definitely pride themselves on cooking fresh and healthy. Misti would not order Dal Makhani again. Dal Makhani is usually Misti's favorite Indian dish but this is the second time Misti have had Dal Makhani here. Both times Misti have walked away thinking Dal Makhani tasted like a not so great chili. However  Baigan was solid. Misti Misti went with roti instead of naan  and Misti really enjoyed roti. The menu has plenty for meat eaters vegetarians and vegans  and Misti am pretty sure they can help gluten - free eaters as well.

Neither of us liked the chicken curry or the potatoes and cauliflower. Contrary to popular claim the rice was not  basmati. You can not  ever go wrong with mango lassi  mango flavored yogurt drink  and mango lassi mango flavored yogurt drink probably was the best part of our meal. In summary  our food was okay but the alien samosa was a massive FAIL. If you have  never had a samosa please do yourself a favor and grab one from an authentic Indian restaurant.

The lady taking the order repeated your order and confirmed our spice level to make sure it was what Nisha wanted. While Nisha were eating the food The lady taking the order did check on us and asked if Nisha needed anything. The service is quick in comparison to a full fledged restaurant and the food is delicious !  ! The pav bhaji is decent but the chicken itself was fork tender and Chicken Korma was silky  buttery  and scrumptious !  !

Swatee can not  believe Chatpatay serve the food Chatpatay serve and still stay open ! Swatee visited Chatpatay  while taking a break from our road trip and were famished when Swatee got here. It was thanksgiving day  so not much open and very few people inside. First of all  Swatee m confused about whether Chatpatay is self service or not. Someone greeted us at the door and seated us  gave us menus. To place an order  you have to walk up to the counter. Chatpatay bring the dishes to you. You need to grab your own utensils. Chatpatay expect you to place dirty dishes in a far corner yourself. Just extremely confusing and annoying. Swatee have nothing against self service  -  in fact self service is  awesome and efficient  but this weird process made no sense. Anyways -  the food. Swatee started wit the mango chat. the mango chat was made with old papris and was over over sauced. Swatee would be okay with that  -  if th sauce tasted good. th sauce did not  -  way too much heeng and terrible flavor. Lily wanted to paneer -  paneer tasted of nothing  had a weird red color and the texture of rubber. Swatee actually were not able to get through more than   pieces collectively. Swatee also had the garlic naan. Swatee think you should be punished for screwing up something as simple as garlic naan and they totally did not -  too much garlic and uncooked sides  ugh. Swatee had the gobhi parantha and again  -  how you screw up something so simple  Swatee do not  understand. the gobhi parantha was uncooked in placed and Swatee could taste the raw dough. The filling tasted of nothing and there was not   enough of The filling. the gobhi parantha was also slathered with way too much oil  butter Rags loves chicken  -  he did not  like Chatpatay's version of chicken tikka. Everything tasted stale and disgusting. As much as Swatee hate food waste  Swatee ended up trashing about     of the food Swatee ordered and left Chatpatay hungry still.

Good spices  big pieces of lamb  and just so so good with the raita. The only thing Aleeza would not  order again is the gobi paratha. the gobi paratha was a little dry  but Aleeza could tell Chatpatay's parathas are more authentic than other places -  Chatpatay definitely use whole wheat flour  not using enriched bleached flour for American tastes.

The nicest thing is the family that own Royal Ganesha are very very nice and hardworking folks and go out of Thier way to make you feel very welcome. There are only    -    tables open for now but as soon as the upstairs opens up you can bet that Royal Ganesha will be packed to the rim.
