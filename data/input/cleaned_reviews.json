Even though they have expanded to another location in Scarborough  so that there are now two Silver Spoons  the Pickering location has managed to maintain consistent quality  although it can vary on days. Well  what restaurant does not  have that problem  You might be suddenly short - staffed  someone down with the flu   or perhaps one of your deliveries did not  make it on time   It is good food. Katya prefer the Pakistani cuisine :  Nihari  Haleem  not always available  and several of the biryanis. They are now offering Sindhi Biryani on weekends  and Katya m so pleased !  The only way that Katya could get that in the past was to make it myself using a packaged spice blend.  If you want to get Naan  Katya recommend the Butter Naan. Although it costs a bit more  the butter enhancements really take the Naan to the next level of browning and savoury tastes. Ok  things sit under the heat lamp  but they do not seem to suffer that much  particularly something like Nihari  which is a stew - type dish that can withstand the warming table. Everything has always tasted fresh when Katya have ordered it. Katya find that the samosas are fairly standard  but there are other appetizers which are more exciting. For people who like the dark meat of the chicken  Lollypop Chicken is great and consistently good. Katya also enjoy Shami Kabab. If you like fish  do not  skip the Fingerfish  which is consistently tasty. Whenever Katya have been there  which is perhaps once a month or two  for the past five years  the portions have been generous. Katya am certainly a fan  and the Silver Spoon fills an important niche in the local  Pickering community as a convenient place to pick up some Halal take - away of decent quality.", "name": "Katya"}, {"review_id": "r-NLaGpX4hCMraZ9OukN0AnQ", "user_id": "u-Uaqawx2iD0mT5YP_akJrJw", "date": "2014-06-27 00:28:47", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Oh  Silver Spoon. Heli have  tried to love you. Heli have  given you so many chances.   But this just is not  working out anymore.  To start :  the food is not  exactly terrible. It  just...not very good. Heli have  tried almost every meat dish  the chana masala  samosas  biriyanis  etc. Indian take - out is hardly known for its healthiness  but when you order a veal karahi and get two sad chunks of meat floating in half a container in oil  it is  a little disheartening. Add to that the fact that food is often sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long...  On the upside :  the chicken biriyani is good bang for your buck  -  especially during the week when it is  on special. You get a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat. It  ready to go  so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for your order. There was that one time they ran out of chicken biriyani  which is understandable when it is  on special  but then offered me a  regular biriyani   read :  JUST rice  for the same price. Ummm  say what   Heli do love their beef samosas  -  it is  just to bad that they NEVER HAVE ANY. Seriously  Heli have been here early in the evening  at random times during the week  and they have loads of sad looking veggie samosas  but no beef. Heli feel like the owners need to do a serious evaluation of what works and does not  work. If you notice you are  always selling out of a certain item  and NOT another   does not  it make sense to up that portion while downsizing another  Who knows.  My biggest gripe was the chana masala incident. The last time Heli went in  Heli ordered a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about  but my husband likes . The girl at the counter kind of made a face and said   Oh...no. You do not  want that.  Heli was confused. There was a whole tray of it there  brimming with chick - pea goodness.  It  not...good today.    What  What does that mean  Is the taste just  off  or had it spoiled  In either event  why is there a full tray of  not good  chana masala here for customers to look at  and possible walk out the door with   Heli stared at the tray  and she motioned at it again   Heli was just going to remove it from here anyway.   But  um  you did not . And Heli was the only person in the store. From the wide glass window  before Heli even stepped in  Heli could see that there was no one else even there. She had not  even come over until Heli would  been standing there for a few minutes.   It really bothers me that Heli still really do not  know what was so wrong with an entire tray of food that it would warrant being thrown out  -  and why it HADN T been thrown out immediately if it really could not  be saved. It was clear from the crispiness on the top  you know  that kind of layer of  kin  that develops   that it had been sitting for a while. Ultimately  Heli m really quite relieved the staff person told me before Heli bought it  took it home and got diarrhea or something  this would be a much harsher review if that had happened...  And Heli guess that says something positive about the customer service  sorta...   As more and more Indian food places  -  both takeout and dine - in  -  emerge in the region  store owners need to realize that customers are going to eventually become more discerning. Heli really wanted this place to be a favorite  -  after all  it is  very convenient for me  -  but  sorry  Silver Spoon  you just do not  make the cut.", "name": "Heli"}, {"review_id": "r-ZAmkMWTSbWQRO-uEzYmR8g", "user_id": "u-pj7M1RIWV0caCp7Kj91JxA", "date": "2014-12-17 03:39:34", "rating": 3.0, "text": "They do not have lots of crowd and it taste is different than other locations.

Chicken Biryani Tuesdays !   How can you beat that    Stephanie knew there was going to be a problem when Stephanie saw the door wide open.  Keep in mind that it was like   C yesterday.

Canadian Tire Home Depot are your neighbours  why do not  you just buy some fans and write them off as a business expense   Owners  this is not a good look !   Aside from that  there was still a line - up of post -   -  ers coming in to grab some grub for their hungry families.    A female customer ahead of me what telling worker which pieces of mutton to grab  -  without the bone.   Makes sense  as you do not  really want a container full of bone  +  sauce for dinner.   She was being soo demanding  yet the worker did not  flinch one bit.  That was pretty impressive as Stephanie would have  exploding  especially with the heat !   Stephanie got a Chicken Biryani to - go    .    maybe   -   pieces of chicken  pretty good flavour  -  can not  complain for price    a Matar Paneer    .   for a large  not enough paneer  mostly peas   gravy .    Perhaps Stephanie should have  taken note from that demanding customer and directed the worker to scoop up more pieces of paneer !   Whatever the case maybe  both dishes were more than acceptable to me.  Along with the questionable management  re :   no - AC   the food handling is somewhat suspect as well.

Pierre have to say Pierre have  definitely had better Indian food for some reason the taste does seen rather bland for authentic Indian cuisine  Pierre think the chiefs play it safe with the level of spice. Most dishes are delicious it just seems like something is missing for it to be considered real great Indian cuisine. Pierre do not know enough about how to cook Indian food to say exactly what it is. Pierre like the fact that the dishes are not salty  the only time Pierre feel bad from the food is when Pierre eat to much. The tandoori although good seems a little short on flavor  small pieces the butter chicken is quite disappointing it is very rich and does not  taste  like butter chicken Pierre remember from other restaurants  not to mention it has bones in it what a sin. There always seems to be more sauce than chicken.The pieces Pierre thought were quite small. The beef dish is good  the curry goat and chicken not so much the meat on these dishes seems very tough  Pierre think they use the cheapest meat for the buffet. Pierre have not   tried the dishes on the menu yet bet Pierre assume they are allot better. The veggie dishes seem old like they have  been sitting their for days  overall the buffet does not seem to heat the food Pierre have never seen the dishes really hot there not cold just lukewarm. The only hot item is when they bring the Nan bread from the oven. Pierre really wish they had more of those famous  Indian deserts  instead of ice cream which Pierre do not  think is sanitary to leave it there and everybody dig in to it and they need to cover it separately as well not just the door. The service unfortunately is not that great either the owner is very friendly  however the waiters seem disengaged like they just want to go home  no small talk no smile nothing. The worst thing for me about being served in a restaurant is when Pierre have to ask for EVERYTHING  Pierre do not  mind sometimes but Pierre always have to ask for another drink  more water  napkins remove bottles etc. every single time. The place does give the appearance of being clean especially the washrooms which is one of the reasons Pierre go back. Pierre must say Pierre have seen attitude from some of the staff again not the owner who is always professional. On one occasion a girl working there who Pierre never seen  before or ever since actually spoke rather rudely to me in an unfriendly tone for putting a little sauce back on the buffet dish from my plate OMG Call the police lol. Last thing Pierre want to address is the decor definitely needs an upgrade seating could be set up better to maximize space  the carpet looks old and decrepit and the T.V looks nice but Pierre have  never seen it on. Pierre do not  think they want to pay for cable and no clock  whats up with that  oh Pierre get it do not  let people know what time it is so they wo not  leave to soon or have another beverage. The thing Pierre hate about the buffet section is there is no light Pierre think it should be the other way around lots of light to see the buffet and less light in the dinning room perhaps candles would make for a better dinning experience  flowers would create ambience  sometimes the music is too loud for dinning.  Pierre think rather than everybody so close to each other in the dinning room they should use the other room as well especially on the weekends where seating is an issue. One more thing  through the week business is petty slow sometimes only me and a few people are there.So why play games with the few customers you have  one time a waiter who is no longer there charged me imported price for domestic beer Pierre brought it to the owner  attention and he adjusted the bill the next time Pierre went  no apologies were given everybody know  Budweiser is domestic duh. Another time Pierre specifically asked for a Canada Dry Ginger Ale and that is  the name it is listed as on the menu  the owner brings it to me and life is good. The next one Pierre ordered he brings no name ginger ale Pierre was so angry Pierre just left as soon as Pierre finished the meal Pierre did not  want to lose it. Ant the no name of course tastes like crap that is  why its cheap but he still charged me the   .  . One time the said waiter who is no longer there when Pierre asked him to remove the bottles from the table  he said you have a big table with lots of room. What the hell is he talking to me like that for. Unbelievable this is not how you talk to customers who pay your bills. As you can imagine it was reflected in the tip. Another time they tried to give me a bottle of beer that was opened for days flat as hell  they corrected that when Pierre  spoke up about it. Look Pierre m not saying to avoid this place at all  Pierre just know they could make it a whole lot better. Pierre usually go alone and Pierre have  noticed the more people the better the service. the  bigger the tip  By all means check it out the buffet used to be    .   they just raised it to    .   but the buffet items did not change at all  nothing new added go figure.", "name": "Pierre"}, {"review_id": "r-bA9_SyRS3Z3h5IgMpEgt-A", "user_id": "u-rlqSOqnC4IDP612W2DlYLw", "date": "2013-11-26 19:34:31", "rating": 1.0, "text": "Went there for a Sunday lunch party.

When the waiter came he offered water or pop or alcoholic drinks but he stated instead of getting individual glass of pop  its better to get the jar.

After checking out the buffet  Amanda opted to have butter chicken off the menu  hoping that that at least would be hot and fresh. When it arrived  it was hot  but the cuts of meat were terrible. It did not  seem like it was the chicken breast that the menu promised it would be. Amanda picked at it  and hardly ate it.   Meanwhile  my family was waiting for them to refill the buffet. It seemed like they brought one item out every    minutes  even though the buffet was empty. The naan took the longest to restock  and it always seems flat and cold when it got there.

Michael have never seen that done before.   Anyway  the three of us ordered a bunch of different dishes and enjoyed sharing the flavors and food items. Michael think my favorite was the GOBI     which was fried cauliflower. It was magnificently prepared with the best spices. The Gobi was preceded by paneer  which is an Indian cheese  cut into square pieces and served with onions and peppers. Michael also ordered one of the curry dishes and a Ravaa Dosa  which was served with chutney and lentil soup.  The dosa was served flat on the plate  as opposed to the rolled up dosas that Michael have had in the past.  Finally  Michael shared some cheese bread.  Michael can not  say enough greats things about the quality of the food and the flavors.   There were two things that Michael thought could have been better.  The dishes could have been served a little warmer than what they were.  The second thing is that the service was painfully slow.  It took at least    minutes for our first dish to be served.  And it stayed slow  all the way til the end of our meal. Perhaps they are undergoing start up pains or perhaps they were understaffed tonight.  No sure.

Nikki had a group of about    people  so Nikki ordered several to share. My hands - down favorite was the butter chicken dosa. The buffet had your basic Indian staples  plus a hot chai tea. A bottle of water  the buffet  and made to order dosas  =  about    . Great price.   Other notes :  you can place orders online. You can also choose your level of spiciness for each dish. They also offer breakfast Friday - Sunday from   -   am. For the lunch crowd  they have a promo where you can get a free lunch buffet when you purchase nine buffets.

In a similar vein  the food was OK  but it was missing the potency so signature of Indian spice  that fragrance that is  supposed to envelop you when at Indian restaurants. Where is the meaty grilledness in the tandoori chicken  Where is that earthy cumin in your samosa  Everything just tasted kind of...impotent. Henry can not  tell if it is  because they are  trying to pander to Midwestern tastes or if they are  skimping on the spices for business reasons  but Henry left the place without the taste of pungency that Henry was really hoping to load up on when Henry go to Indian buffets.

But the service today was REALLY BAD !  A coworker of mine ordered a chicken wrap  Lia know for a fact that she ordered chicken since she was young she never ate BEEF because of her religion so there is no way in hell that she will ever order BEEF. So she got her wrap and she started eating it. Since its a wrap unless you disassemble it you would not know by the looks of it whether it was red or white meat inside so she took a bite and ate it. Never in her life she tasted beef so she ask us taste it since it tasted weird for her. So Lia disassembled the wrap at this point and tasted the meat inside it. It was beef !  !  !  !  !  At that point my coworker talked to the cashier and informed her that instead of giving her chicken  she gave her beef. Instead of apologizing  she raised her voice to my coworker and told her she made a mistake on her order which was not true at all. Unfortunately  Lia do not  have a proof since the receipt just says lunch special. She did not apologized   she did not even offer to give her a replacement. At this point my coworker even though clearly upset but hungry  ordered another chicken wrap despite us telling her not to do it and Lia can just transfer to another restaurant. Lia was well tempted to just really make a scene but Lia do not  want to stoop down to her level. The   of us and all other people that Lia know of swear never again to go back to this restaurant !   Lia understand that the reason that the cashier would have not  admitted her mistake was that it might end up that she foot the bill. But what Lia do not  understand is why she needs to raise her voice to my coworker.   A simple hint of humility could have been ok. If there is   stars  Lia will definitely give this place that.

She and Steven had a long discussion about what was dry chicken and what was not .  Steven asked her for a new batch of chicken and conveniently they were now out of the whole chicken tandoori !   She said she could give us chicken breast  which Steven have had before. Steven agreed and waited. While Steven was waiting she informed me that the chef said the cook on the chicken was fine.  Steven told her that he should eat then.  When the new meal came the chicken pieces were tiny as if they had took a regular piece and cut it in half to make it look like there was more chicken.  Steven bit into it and again it was dry and if it was worse than the first batch.    At this point Steven had had enough and just ate the food.    After Steven finished  Steven told the lady and the cook that Steven had been before and it was good and this time it was horrible.  They did not offer me a free desert or drink or a refund.

Malinda have  lived all over the country  and have had Indian enough to know ...  good from great . Soma Grill is truly  great  food. Malinda have  been to this place with my husband over a dozen times and Malinda will  keep coming back.   Why  you ask    Well  the answer is simple. The food is hand made every day  the staff is full of heart and spirt  and the owner is a wonderful woman who truly cares about her guests.  Here  some things Malinda would  like to brag about eating there :   Start with the :  Vegetable Samosa   comes with an order of two and two dipping sauces   -  these triangular delights are a perfect way to start your meal. The green dipping sauce is perfectly spicy and compliments the brown sweet dipping sauce. YUM !  !  !    For dinner Malinda share. Here  what Malinda love there ... but first  you must know dinner comes with a cup of mildly spicy and delicious lentil soup  as well as a fresh salad. The salad has a zesty yogurt dressing lightly garnishing the top of it. Now for the main course.  Chicken Tikka Masala  this comes in a light red orange cream sauce  The chicken is tender and the sauce has a bold rich tomato flavor. Mmmmm ... Get the Naan to dip in this sauce so no drop goes to waste.   Lamb Kashmiri  this has a mild burgandy sauce with almonds in it  The lamb tastes like it has been cooking all day. If you have  ever had  osso bucco  from an Italian restaurant ... you know that succulent meat that falls off the bone. This lamb is as tender as that. AND the sauce  it has a ton of flavor. If you eat lamb this is something you must try.   Fish  Cod  Madras  this is perfectly cooked white fish in a very fresh rich colored tomato sauce with onions and mushrooms  What Malinda really like about this dish is how much it complements the heavier flavors in the tikka massala  cream sauce.   If you are  looking for a vegetable dish my husband and Malinda have tried a few of them. Our favorite is the  Aloo Gobi    Aloo Gobi  this dish has potato  and cauliflower mixed in a light  fresh crushed tomato sauce  It  very good and a nice compliment to all the meat dishes Malinda order  to share.   Malinda have  had both the garlic and regular naan. They are  perfect for dipping  and in my opinion  naan is a  must have  when eating an Indian meal.   Rice comes with the meals  so if you do not  want bread but want a starch  you will  be happy to know white rice accompanies all entrees.   As for dessert Malinda have  had the rice pudding and pistachio ice - cream  this is the kulfi  on the menu. Between those two  Malinda would  pick the pistachio ice - cream every time. It  very refreshing after a hot meal.   Also  each time Malinda visit Malinda always get the hot chai tea. This milky goodness is made to order and is worth the wait. You add the sugar which puts you in the drivers seat  as far as sweetness goes.  Malinda recommend Soma Grill to anyone looking to try something other than a chain restaurant. This food is worth a try and if you already like Indian food take my dinner suggestions. You wo not  be sorry !    Hope this helps  -  -  Enjoy !

The food is always fresh  the portions are big  and the prices are reasonable.   Eva have tried the Tandoori Kabob  Chicken Breast Kabob  and Chaplee Kabob. My favourite is definitely the Tandoori Kabob. The chicken was juicy and flavourful  with a bit of a kick. The chicken breast is good if you are not  looking for something spicy. As for the Chaplee Kabob  it was my first time trying this dish. Eva liked the marinade and the meat was cooked perfectly  but it was quite oily...  The salad is always fresh and Eva love the Afghani bread  especially dipped in both the sauces . For about    more  you can get a dinner platter which comes with quite a bit of basmati rice.   Watan Kabob has a fairly straightforward ordering system. You just have to order and pay at the counter  then wait until your number is called.   It can be quite busy  even on a weeknight  packed with families and children playing hide - and - seek behind you.   Watan Kabob is very similar to Bamiyan Kabob  Eva read in an earlier review that the owner of Watan Kabob used to work there . However  it differs from a restaurant with waiter service  an extensive menu  and more comfortable seating  like Paramount. Unfortunately  Watan Kabob does not make the thick garlic sauce that Paramount offers  but Eva enjoyed the food at Watan Kabob more and the menu is more reasonably priced. The only reason Eva would return to Paramount is for their appetizers  manakeesh  and baklawa.", "name": "Eva"}, {"review_id": "r-INPxAjbcigWkT12ZcN8p3A", "user_id": "u-LWu1oEhz4jhiV1o5K4amKA", "date": "2016-08-06 03:08:52", "rating": 1.0, "text": "'Hiraa would give them    .

The Gobi was delicious and best Sujith had till date in AZ. Veg dum biriyani was equally tasty. Sujith went for the weekend buffet and there were tons of items.

She brought us an appetizer of Corn Vepudu  roasted kernels with just a bit of a bite on the back end. Pete could eat that stuff like popcorn  very tasty.   For entrees  Pete got Kadai Chicken  tender chunks in a medium - spice tomato based sauce  not the sort of thing Pete would  usually order  but there is  a great variety there  and it was delish ; and the old standby Saag Paneer  which is often sort of bland  but this was quite spicy  and it made me wonder why everyone does not  serve it so fiery  Fantastic.   Added some garlic naan  which was a little thinner than Pete m used to  but that was an interesting change. For drinks  they had some summer specials that were very unusual to our palates  -  -  mine was a faintly salty lemonade  my wife had a mint cooler. These have required me to reassess my opinion of traditional American soft drinks  and Pete now think Pete could stand some more exotic ingredients.   Overall  Pete will  say not your average Indian restaurant  with a wide variety of options Pete will  need to explore my next time through Arizona.

They bring out different chutneys to dip in the pieces your rip off. Not only was this fun  but it was absolutely delicious !  They have many different varieties so step out of your comfort zone and give it a try. Taerra were also impressed with the wide selection of goat dishes. The meat fell right off the bones and the sauces were super rich and flavorful.   After polishing off the best mango lassi Taerra have  had out here  Taerra were commenting how Taerra could not  eat another bite...but then Vischu tempted us with a dessert Taerra have  never tried. It  called Double Ka Meeta and Taerra loved it !  Take apple pie and remove the apples and marry it with bread pudding and you have Double Ka Meeta. It was sweet and comforting.

My dad had suggested this restaurant during our family trip to Las Vegas due to the positive reviews from  customers . However  Hello immediately had a sinking feeling when Hello entered the restaurant and noticed that the place was empty. Completely silent !  In fact  there was not even a worker or owner present until my uncle whistled  prompting the owner to rush towards us and seated us. After he seated us  Hello waited a few minutes  and when water did not  show  Hello felt annoyed that Hello had to ask for water. It  a restaurant  Jesus Christ  !  In addition  Hello noticed the lack of papadum and the various chutneys Hello was familiar with receiving at every Indian restaurant Hello had ever been too. However  Hello forgave this as maybe things are not the same in Vegas as Los Angeles. On the topic of service  every single item Hello ordered took absurdly long to prepare  considering Hello were the ONLY customers present. In fact  one of my uncles had specially ordered a Chana masala without onion and garlic because he does not  eat that. The item did not  even show up until the rest of us had almost finished eating.   Service aside  let  move on to the most important part :  quality of food. The vegetable Pakora  the first appetizer  was literally a cauliflower fried in unseasoned batter which was disgusting. Hell  anyone could make better pakoras than what was prepared by Armaan Taste of India. On some pieces  Hello could see the raw cauliflower which had none of the flavorless batter. Unappetizing much  Hello decided to clear my mind; perhaps the main dishes would be somewhat decent. Oh boy  was Hello wrong !  The paneer tikka masala tasted like someone had dumped heaps of tomato paste  tomato pur e  and chunks of tomato  with sugar and small sprinkles of Indian spices. This was despite my request for extremely spicy paneer tikka masala. The malai kofta gravy tasted like raw sewage diluted with turmeric and chilly power. By far  the most disgusting dish. The channa masala which my uncle had ordered looked like little shit pieces in brown gravy. The next morning  my uncle said he threw up all of the disgusting channa masala.   Hello presume the high ratings are from non - Indians who do not  know how delicious Indian food can be when prepared properly. To you  Hello suggest visiting restaurants recommended by any Indians you may know. Once you visit a proper Indian restaurant  you will agree with my review and agree with how an abomination of a restaurant Armaan Taste of India is.", "name": "Hello"}, {"review_id": "r-HYW87hBE0kiJon3DNVPtJw", "user_id": "u-e0KcqeKhCnwL1UZRGLv6_Q", "date": "2018-10-15 00:31:01", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Really good food with really good flavors.

A    .   buffet needs to be worth that much  and Indian m sorry  but Matka is not  worth it  but Chutneys totally is.", "name": "Indian"}, {"review_id": "r-p9WiZ41sps_6lgdoQA4IeQ", "user_id": "u-OVFFbN9ij5wFL3UQLhT3pA", "date": "2012-11-25 22:34:00", "rating": 1.0, "text": "Deb have been to this restaurant to have dinner. Deb was told by one of my colleague that the food taste and options are great. But the quality and taste did not come close to what Deb were expecting. Seems like the food was recycled from the lunch buffet. The naans were hard like stone also the mutton biriyani tasted like eating uncooked rice. Frankly speaking Deb would myself cook much better then what Deb had experienced here. Deb would not recommend my friends or relative to have dinner here.", "name": "Deb"}, {"review_id": "r-kUsehQ04Qgx9dJeM2wTxxw", "user_id": "u-JHCs-fyEMnKjWQkQvRSORQ", "date": "2013-06-14 21:45:05", "rating": 1.0, "text": "You can change your name from Matka to Kamat to anything else but if you have to advertise that you are not  recycling   which is re - serving one customers food to another that may have been untouched   and that all food is cooked daily  you have to seriously wonder !   Quality of the butter chicken was ok . The tandoori chicken was dry and old and they dont follow the online buffet menu :  no kheer  only sooji ka halwa which in no way closely resembles a dessert.   Ali rate this as  :   been there done that   Naan was burnt but masala dosa was a nice touch. They also some how ran out of yogurt and couldnt make a Lassi. Thats like a wing place running out of wing sauce..", "name": "Ali"}, {"review_id": "r-3blqTcpLUJ1Uj3pT8hiPlg", "user_id": "u-7jw2VAbnGkr0GF6evuvViQ", "date": "2012-04-22 03:40:49", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Alon went to Matka for dinner and found that they have a buffet.  Food was below average to average.  First of all  the variety seemed rather limited  which is surprising for a buffet.  Alon m not at all a vegetarian  but Alon usually look forward to Indian buffets for the vegetarian choices.  Not so here.  They do have the usual Aloo Gobi  cauliflower dish   Palak Paneer  and the pakoras.  The quality was ok  but nothing special.  As for the meat dishes  the butter chicken rather bland  -  shocking for butter chicken  Alon know.  Disappointing  :  .  They also had a lamb curry  ok  but not as flavorful as most Indian lamb dishes should be   Chili chicken  actually pretty good !    Chicken vindaloo  average   and a few other things that Alon can not  remember since they were relatively nondescript.  The price was acceptable.  The decor was typical.  The service was pleasant enough.  Alon think they just opened  -  in a way  this means that you can give them the benefit of the doubt.  Alon probably wo not  though  since Alon already know of other Indian restaurants that are better.", "name": "Alon"}, {"review_id": "r-yN6ruubQJBCVmcMuADLCaQ", "user_id": "u-zHU5uBo_UMGao4wwwiTOfA", "date": "2013-05-27 05:02:55", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Definitely good Indian food. Family came by and shared a few dishes. Miriam had the Spring Vegetable Dosa for appetizer that was super yummy. For main course Miriam split the Vegetable Biryani   Chicken palak   okra and tomatoes  and goat masala.  Everything was EXCELLENT and super TASTY !

Had the Palak Chicken which was good flavor  green sauce with spinach.  A also ordered Poori bread  which had big bubbles that were fun to poke at.  Since it was fried  the kids loved the crunchy top.  Hubby had the Lamb Vindaloo which was spicy and really good flavor  red sauce with lots of good spice.  The food is a little spicy  but A like spicy !   One downer is that A had to keep asking for a water refill  instead of them automatically checking in on us.  Also had the sugarcane drink but it tasted bland  like it was poured out of a can or a gallon  not at all fresh.    Recently  A was disappointed to find out this restaurant received a D from the county  health service  big turn off for any future return.  A had not  planned on it anyway because the bill was too high for   entrees  one extra side of bread and a drink.", "name": "A"}, {"review_id": "r-D4dxkypFBS4TAVj5wt7w1g", "user_id": "u-2mKI7s51PD-W5t8CrCRjNA", "date": "2012-09-09 00:16:52", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Alright here  the skinny :  no beef  Indian cuisine !    lots of flavor in authentic and unique recipes  well - kept buffet fare.    Given a table and a chilled bottle of water Kevin got started.. Two rows of food with an additional row containing some yogurt rice  watermelon  sauces dressings and some meh looking fruit pudding.. Needless to say Kevin kept focused on the main two rows.    As Kevin feasted on several platefuls of delicious goat roganjosh  spicy  chicken      -  sometimes with the butter chicken sauce on top  and some excellent chicken tandoori Kevin was pleased to notice several large Indian families come in to eat  -  aaalways a good sign. Some more highlights include their great egg curry with glazed onions and mango dahl...     The recipes carry an authenticity to them...     stars  -  Recommended for anyone in the area looking to get some Indian food for lunch. Would give a fifth star for a more competitive price  little high on weekends at     +  per adult   a slighttlyyy bigger selection  and dinner buffet availability...  All of which can be found at the Indian Oven in Northeast Mesa.  But overall a good bet for lunch in SW Chandler.", "name": "Kevin"}]}]}
