The food is laid out like a buffet for you to see, and you simply ask the server for the dishes you want.

Even though they have expanded to another location in Scarborough, so that there are now two Silver Spoons, the Pickering location has managed to maintain consistent quality, although it can vary on days.\nWell, what restaurant doesn't have that problem? You might be suddenly short-staffed (someone down with the flu), or perhaps one of your deliveries didn't make it on time? \nIt is good food. I prefer the Pakistani cuisine: Nihari, Haleem (not always available) and several of the biryanis. They are now offering Sindhi Biryani on weekends, and I'm so pleased! The only way that I could get that in the past was to make it myself using a packaged spice blend. \nIf you want to get Naan, I recommend the Butter Naan. Although it costs a bit more, the butter enhancements really take the Naan to the next level of browning and savoury tastes. Ok, things sit under the heat lamp, but they do not seem to suffer that much (particularly something like Nihari, which is a stew-type dish that can withstand the warming table. Everything has always tasted fresh when I have ordered it.\nI find that the samosas are fairly standard, but there are other appetizers which are more exciting. For people who like the dark meat of the chicken, Lollypop Chicken is great and consistently good. I also enjoy Shami Kabab. If you like fish, don't skip the Fingerfish, which is consistently tasty.\nWhenever I have been there, which is perhaps once a month or two, for the past five years, the portions have been generous.\nI am certainly a fan, and the Silver Spoon fills an important niche in the local, Pickering community as a convenient place to pick up some Halal take-away of decent quality.", "name": "Katya"}, {"review_id": "r-NLaGpX4hCMraZ9OukN0AnQ", "user_id": "u-Uaqawx2iD0mT5YP_akJrJw", "date": "2014-06-27 00:28:47", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Oh, Silver Spoon. I've tried to love you. I've given you so many chances. \n\nBut this just isn't working out anymore.\n\nTo start: the food isn't exactly terrible. It's just...not very good. I've tried almost every meat dish, the chana masala, samosas, biriyanis, etc. Indian take-out is hardly known for its healthiness, but when you order a veal karahi and get two sad chunks of meat floating in half a container in oil, it's a little disheartening. Add to that the fact that food is often sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long...\n\nOn the upside: the chicken biriyani is good bang for your buck - especially during the week when it's on special. You get a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat. It's ready to go, so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for your order. There was that one time they ran out of chicken biriyani (which is understandable when it's on special) but then offered me a \"regular biriyani\" (read: JUST rice) for the same price. Ummm, say what?\n\nI do love their beef samosas - it's just to bad that they NEVER HAVE ANY. Seriously, I have been here early in the evening, at random times during the week, and they have loads of sad looking veggie samosas, but no beef. I feel like the owners need to do a serious evaluation of what works and doesn't work. If you notice you're always selling out of a certain item (and NOT another), doesn't it make sense to up that portion while downsizing another? Who knows.\n\nMy biggest gripe was the chana masala incident.\nThe last time I went in, I ordered a chana masala (which I'm apathetic about, but my husband likes). The girl at the counter kind of made a face and said, \"Oh...no. You don't want that.\" I was confused. There was a whole tray of it there, brimming with chick-pea goodness. \"It's not...good today.\" \n\nWhat? What does that mean? Is the taste just 'off' or had it spoiled? In either event, why is there a full tray of \"not good\" chana masala here for customers to look at (and possible walk out the door with)? I stared at the tray, and she motioned at it again, \"I was just going to remove it from here anyway.\"\n\nBut, um, you didn't. And I was the only person in the store. From the wide glass window, before I even stepped in, I could see that there was no one else even there. She hadn't even come over until I'd been standing there for a few minutes. \n\nIt really bothers me that I still really don't know what was so wrong with an entire tray of food that it would warrant being thrown out - and why it HADN'T been thrown out immediately if it really couldn't be saved. It was clear from the crispiness on the top (you know, that kind of layer of 'skin' that develops?) that it had been sitting for a while. Ultimately, I'm really quite relieved the staff person told me before I bought it, took it home and got diarrhea or something (this would be a much harsher review if that had happened...) And I guess that says something positive about the customer service (sorta...)\n\nAs more and more Indian food places - both takeout and dine-in - emerge in the region, store owners need to realize that customers are going to eventually become more discerning. I really wanted this place to be a favorite - after all, it's very convenient for me - but, sorry, Silver Spoon, you just don't make the cut.", "name": "Heli"}, {"review_id": "r-ZAmkMWTSbWQRO-uEzYmR8g", "user_id": "u-pj7M1RIWV0caCp7Kj91JxA", "date": "2014-12-17 03:39:34", "rating": 3.0, "text": "They do not have lots of crowd and it taste is different than other locations.

We are all big fans of Indian food who eat at Indian restaurants, locally and internationally, on a regular basis.  The service at Spice South was pretty poor.

When we asked for chutney or something like it, we were told \"we don't have chutney\". I ordered a lamb dish which, although it was edible and spiced perfectly, was very chewy. I felt quite lucky as another person at our table didn't receive their food at all. We had to track down our apologetic waiter to ask about her order.  Her food eventually showed up, but not until after the rest of us had pretty much finished our meals.

I have to say I've definitely had better Indian food for some reason the taste does seen rather bland for authentic Indian cuisine  I think the chiefs play it safe with the level of spice. Most dishes are delicious it just seems like something is missing for it to be considered real great Indian cuisine. I do not know enough about how to cook Indian food to say exactly what it is. I like the fact that the dishes are not salty, the only time I feel bad from the food is when I eat to much. The tandoori although good seems a little short on flavor, small pieces the butter chicken is quite disappointing it is very rich and doesn't taste \nlike butter chicken I remember from other restaurants, not to mention it has bones in it what a sin. There always seems to be more sauce than chicken.The pieces I thought were quite small. The beef dish is good, the curry goat and chicken not so much the meat on these dishes seems very tough, I think they use the cheapest meat for the buffet. I haven't  tried the dishes on the menu yet bet I assume they are allot better. The veggie dishes seem old like they've been sitting their for days, overall the buffet does not seem to heat the food I have never seen the dishes really hot there not cold just lukewarm. The only hot item is when they bring the Nan bread from the oven. I really wish they had more of those famous  Indian\ndeserts, instead of ice cream which I don't think is sanitary to leave it there and everybody dig in to it and they need to cover it separately as well not just the door. The service unfortunately is not that great either the owner is very friendly, however the waiters seem disengaged like they just want to go home, no small talk no smile nothing. The worst thing for me about being served in a restaurant is when I have to ask for EVERYTHING, I don't mind sometimes but I always have to ask for another drink, more water, napkins remove bottles etc. every single time. The place does give the appearance of being clean especially the washrooms which is one of the reasons I go back. I must say I have seen attitude from some of the staff again not the owner who is always professional. On one occasion a girl working there who I never seen  before or ever since actually spoke rather rudely to me in an unfriendly tone for putting a little sauce back on the buffet dish from my plate OMG Call the police lol. Last thing I want to address is the decor definitely needs an upgrade seating could be set up better to maximize space, the carpet looks old and decrepit and the T.V looks nice but I've never seen it on. I don't think they want to pay for cable and no clock, whats up with that, oh I get it don't let people know what time it is so they won't leave to soon or have another beverage. The thing I hate about the buffet section is there is no light I think it should be the other way around lots of light to see the buffet and less light in the dinning room perhaps candles would make for a better dinning experience, flowers would create ambience, sometimes the music is too loud for dinning.  I think rather than everybody so close to each other in the dinning room they should use the other room as well especially on the weekends where seating is an issue. One more thing, through the week business is petty slow sometimes only me and a few people are there.So why play games with the few customers you have, one time a waiter who is no longer there charged me imported price for domestic beer I brought it to the owner's attention and he adjusted the bill the next time I went, no apologies were given everybody know's Budweiser is domestic duh. Another time I specifically asked for a Canada Dry Ginger Ale and that's the name it is listed as on the menu, the owner brings it to me and life is good. The next one I ordered he brings no name ginger ale I was so angry I just left as soon as I finished the meal I didn't want to lose it. Ant the no name of course tastes like crap that's why its cheap but he still charged me the $2.50. One time the said waiter who is no longer there when I asked him to remove the bottles from the table, he said you have a big table with lots of room. What the hell is he talking to me like that for. Unbelievable this is not how you talk to customers who pay your bills. As you can imagine it was reflected in the tip. Another time they tried to give me a bottle of beer that was opened for days flat as hell, they corrected that when I  spoke up about it.\nLook I'm not saying to avoid this place at all, I just know they could make it a whole lot better.\nI usually go alone and I've noticed the more people the better the service.(the  bigger the tip) By all means check it out the buffet used to be $10.95 they just raised it to $14.95 but the buffet items did not change at all, nothing new added go figure.", "name": "Pierre"}, {"review_id": "r-bA9_SyRS3Z3h5IgMpEgt-A", "user_id": "u-rlqSOqnC4IDP612W2DlYLw", "date": "2013-11-26 19:34:31", "rating": 1.0, "text": "Went there for a Sunday lunch party.

In my opinion, the food was actually quite tasty. But I feel like the spice of the food was toned down quite a bit to make it a little bit more palatable for non-Indian diners. I like my food VERY SPICY, and I wish I asked for like chilies or something. \n\n- The Butter chicken was good. Even though a buffet, the chicken was not dry. \n- I was afraid that the Tandoori Chicken would be dry but it actually wasn't. It was mostly dark meat but the chicken was not dry at all. \n- They had some Indian style pasta which I thought was quite funny (I whispered to my brother... \"this is for white people\" LOL).\n- The rest of the food? I don't even remember what they were called. I think I had Aloo Gobi or something (Potato/cauliflower curry) but they were all quite tasty.\n\nWhat got me really excited..... UNLIMITED NAAN BREAD, and you don't even have to ask for it. It keeps refilling itself.\n\n\n~SERVICE\nThe servers were quite attentive. We did not have to wait for them to refill our drinks/water. I did not have to ask them to give us more naan bread, they just kept coming. The only time we had to ask them for something was when we needed our bill.\n\n\n~OVERALL EXPERIENCE\nIt was good.

The cart with the food  wasn't even full. Once we ate food  we had to use the same plate to get food again if we wanted seconds.

It was only 5:15pm on a Monday and super busy ... excellent selection of food items (overwhelming when you are not too sure what you are in the mood for).  We got the Chili Chicken, Chicken Curry and Chicken Biryani combo - generous portions, excellent spice rating (real deal spice) - busy place, staff super helpful and friendly and go out of their way to describe the individual dishes.  2 Huge servings for $18.08 of combo for 2 people.\n\nBig thanks to the guy from Oshawa in the line-up next to us who was super helpful in what to order (now I understand why he drove all the way from Oshawa for this grub....its very good). Another plus for Ajax having this place ( I am only the second person to review considering this place is the busiest place in the new mall I expect more reviews with good writeup's forthcoming from others)....  absolutely a must try (Ajax just keeps getting better and better \"food-wise\").  The food is in those buffet style hotplate's that keep food \"warm\"; so isn't scalding hot by any means - but still tasty none the less.  Most customers were take-out  (there is a seating area with a few people sitting down having food).  There are frozen paratha's and frozen food items in the freezer section (that they have made).\n\nBig plus having so many ethnic places in Ajax that have good food, decent portions, good prices and excellent quality of ingredients.

We also ordered one of the curry dishes and a Ravaa Dosa, which was served with chutney and lentil soup.  The dosa was served flat on the plate, as opposed to the rolled up dosas that I have had in the past.  Finally, we shared some cheese bread.  I can't say enough greats things about the quality of the food and the flavors.   There were two things that we thought could have been better.  The dishes could have been served a little warmer than what they were.  The second thing is that the service was painfully slow.  It took at least 30 minutes for our first dish to be served.  And it stayed slow, all the way til the end of our meal. Perhaps they are undergoing start up pains or perhaps they were understaffed tonight.  No sure.  What I will remember is the how my palette jumped up and down with each bite.   There is a bar in the restaurant, but the emphasis seems to be on beer and wine.

To be 100% honest with you, I didn't know what a Dosa is - it's essentially a folded crepe. \nRed Chillez offers a traditional buffet with some non-standard items. I really enjoyed trying all of the dips and spreads and figuring out what I loved and what I still haven't acquired a taste for. In addition to the buffet, there are Dosa menus on the tables for you to basically order bottomless, made-to-order Dosas.

The dosa menu has six vegetarian options, three non-veg, and three kid-friendly options. We had a group of about 12 people, so we ordered several to share. My hands-down favorite was the butter chicken dosa. The buffet had your basic Indian staples, plus a hot chai tea. A bottle of water, the buffet, and made to order dosas = about $14. Great price. \n\nOther notes: you can place orders online. You can also choose your level of spiciness for each dish. They also offer breakfast Friday-Sunday from 8-11am. For the lunch crowd, they have a promo where you can get a free lunch buffet when you purchase nine buffets.\n\nHighly recommend checking this place out on a Tuesday.

Granted, all the ones I've been to have been on the East Coast, so this might be great for Madison/Wisconsin. I got my usual mango lassi to accompany my meal, and it came with whipped cream and maraschino cherries and what seemed to be grenadine. Why would you do that? Not only does the mango not taste like real mango, the lassi came out way sweeter than any I've had and probably sweeter than any proper lassi you'd find in India. In a similar vein, the food was OK, but it was missing the potency so signature of Indian spice, that fragrance that's supposed to envelop you when at Indian restaurants. Where is the meaty grilledness in the tandoori chicken? Where is that earthy cumin in your samosa? Everything just tasted kind of...impotent. I can't tell if it's because they're trying to pander to Midwestern tastes or if they're skimping on the spices for business reasons, but I left the place without the taste of pungency that I was really hoping to load up on when I go to Indian buffets.\n\nPS - After reading a few reviews from some Indian customers that also mentioned that they could improve their flavor, I feel like less of a crazy person.

But the service today was REALLY BAD! A coworker of mine ordered a chicken wrap, i know for a fact that she ordered chicken since she was young she never ate BEEF because of her religion so there is no way in hell that she will ever order BEEF. So she got her wrap and she started eating it. Since its a wrap unless you disassemble it you would not know by the looks of it whether it was red or white meat inside so she took a bite and ate it. Never in her life she tasted beef so she ask us taste it since it tasted weird for her. So we disassembled the wrap at this point and tasted the meat inside it. It was beef!!!!! At that point my coworker talked to the cashier and informed her that instead of giving her chicken, she gave her beef. Instead of apologizing, she raised her voice to my coworker and told her she made a mistake on her order which was not true at all. Unfortunately  we don't have a proof since the receipt just says lunch special. She did not apologized , she did not even offer to give her a replacement. At this point my coworker even though clearly upset but hungry  ordered another chicken wrap despite us telling her not to do it and we can just transfer to another restaurant. I was well tempted to just really make a scene but We don't want to stoop down to her level. The 5 of us and all other people that we know of swear never again to go back to this restaurant!  I understand that the reason that the cashier would have not  admitted her mistake was that it might end up that she foot the bill. But what I don't understand is why she needs to raise her voice to my coworker.   A simple hint of humility could have been ok. If there is 0 stars, i will definitely give this place that.

I told her that he should eat then.  When the new meal came the chicken pieces were tiny as if they had took a regular piece and cut it in half to make it look like there was more chicken.

I've lived all over the country, and have had Indian enough to know ... \"good from great\". Soma Grill is truly \"great\" food. I've been to this place with my husband over a dozen times and we'll keep coming back. \n\nWhy, you ask? \n\nWell, the answer is simple. The food is hand made every day, the staff is full of heart and spirt, and the owner is a wonderful woman who truly cares about her guests.\n\nHere's some things I'd like to brag about eating there:\n\nStart with the:\nVegetable Samosa's (comes with an order of two and two dipping sauces) - these triangular delights are a perfect way to start your meal. The green dipping sauce is perfectly spicy and compliments the brown sweet dipping sauce. YUM!!!\n \nFor dinner we share. Here's what we love there ... but first, you must know dinner comes with a cup of mildly spicy and delicious lentil soup, as well as a fresh salad. The salad has a zesty yogurt dressing lightly garnishing the top of it. Now for the main course.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala (this comes in a light red/orange cream sauce) The chicken is tender and the sauce has a bold rich tomato flavor. Mmmmm ... Get the Naan to dip in this sauce so no drop goes to waste. \n\nLamb Kashmiri (this has a mild burgandy sauce with almonds in it) The lamb tastes like it has been cooking all day. If you've ever had \"osso bucco\" from an Italian restaurant ... you know that succulent meat that falls off the bone. This lamb is as tender as that. AND the sauce, it has a ton of flavor. If you eat lamb this is something you must try. \n\nFish (Cod) Madras (this is perfectly cooked white fish in a very fresh rich colored tomato sauce with onions and mushrooms) What I really like about this dish is how much it complements the heavier flavors in the tikka massala's cream sauce. \n\nIf you're looking for a vegetable dish my husband and I have tried a few of them. Our favorite is the \"Aloo Gobi\" \n\nAloo Gobi (this dish has potato's and cauliflower mixed in a light, fresh crushed tomato sauce) It's very good and a nice compliment to all the meat dishes we order  to share. \n\nWe've had both the garlic and regular naan. They're perfect for dipping, and in my opinion, naan is a \"must have\" when eating an Indian meal. \n\nRice comes with the meals, so if you don't want bread but want a starch, you'll be happy to know white rice accompanies all entrees. \n\nAs for dessert we've had the rice pudding and pistachio ice-cream (this is the kulfi) on the menu. Between those two, I'd pick the pistachio ice-cream every time. It's very refreshing after a hot meal. \n\nAlso, each time we visit I always get the hot chai tea. This milky goodness is made to order and is worth the wait. You add the sugar which puts you in the drivers seat, as far as sweetness goes.\n\nI recommend Soma Grill to anyone looking to try something other than a chain restaurant. This food is worth a try and if you already like Indian food take my dinner suggestions. You won't be sorry! \n\nHope this helps -- Enjoy!", "name": "Malinda"}, {"review_id": "r-s6yZiTquKMnEwBUOgnXkWA", "user_id": "u-tLb-WQFc2fHo5MgF4DwSVw", "date": "2012-01-08 18:32:17", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Nice little hole-in-the-wally sort of place, with the feeling of a family owned neighborhood joint mainly patronized by locals.

This dish could be served in a fine restaurant.\n\nAnother surprise: I usually don't go crazy for Asian deserts but we shared a pudding of carrots, raisins, cashews, rice sugar and cream ( Halwah? ) that manage to taste very unusual, yet familiar and delish as well. \n\nAn Indian couple seem to own and run this place, the wife is the cook and she really aims to please. She came out to our table 3 times to talk to us although there were a fair amount of customers - mostly Indians. We had dinner there twice and I think this lady does her best with the vegetarian dishes. I tend to be a meat eater myself but I'll stick to their vegetarian menu in the future\n\nThey also have a decent wine selection for $5 a glass which doesn't hurt the dining experience.", "name": "George"}, {"review_id": "r-2NPL-7A4oBN8uWkRg0JSuA", "user_id": "u-HVq7SYfZ4hpFFVsAU_Ub_Q", "date": "2013-07-25 19:09:22", "rating": 4.0, "text": "I finally was able to make it here for lunch, and I'm so glad I did!

My favourite is definitely the Tandoori Kabob. The chicken was juicy and flavourful, with a bit of a kick. The chicken breast is good if you aren't looking for something spicy. As for the Chaplee Kabob, it was my first time trying this dish. I liked the marinade and the meat was cooked perfectly, but it was quite oily...\n\nThe salad is always fresh and I love the Afghani bread (especially dipped in both the sauces). For about $2 more, you can get a dinner platter which comes with quite a bit of basmati rice. \n\nWatan Kabob has a fairly straightforward ordering system. You just have to order and pay at the counter, then wait until your number is called. \n\nIt can be quite busy, even on a weeknight, packed with families and children playing hide-and-seek behind you. \n\nWatan Kabob is very similar to Bamiyan Kabob (I read in an earlier review that the owner of Watan Kabob used to work there). However, it differs from a restaurant with waiter service, an extensive menu, and more comfortable seating, like Paramount. Unfortunately, Watan Kabob does not make the thick garlic sauce that Paramount offers, but I enjoyed the food at Watan Kabob more and the menu is more reasonably priced. The only reason I would return to Paramount is for their appetizers, manakeesh, and baklawa.", "name": "Eva"}, {"review_id": "r-INPxAjbcigWkT12ZcN8p3A", "user_id": "u-LWu1oEhz4jhiV1o5K4amKA", "date": "2016-08-06 03:08:52", "rating": 1.0, "text": "I would give them 0/5.

I was pretty pleased they had many more veg items compared to 4 non-veg dishes. I the never seen a veg biriyani being part of buffet. It was always chicken biriyani. So my non-veg friends were not too pleased with this. They had a paneer pulao so I would suggest to replace that with a non-veg rice item. For me the highlight was Aloo Bonda and the fried baby corn.

Our waitress, Sri, asked if we like spicy. I told her yes, but that she shouldn't take that as a challenge. Sri gave me a sly grin that said \"challenge accepted!\"\n\nShe brought us an appetizer of Corn Vepudu, roasted kernels with just a bit of a bite on the back end. I could eat that stuff like popcorn, very tasty. \n\nFor entrees, we got Kadai Chicken, tender chunks in a medium-spice tomato based sauce (not the sort of thing I'd usually order, but there's a great variety there, and it was delish); and the old standby Saag Paneer, which is often sort of bland, but this was quite spicy, and it made me wonder why everyone doesn't serve it so fiery? Fantastic. \n\nAdded some garlic naan, which was a little thinner than I'm used to, but that was an interesting change. For drinks, they had some summer specials that were very unusual to our palates -- mine was a faintly salty lemonade, my wife had a mint cooler. These have required me to reassess my opinion of traditional American soft drinks, and I now think we could stand some more exotic ingredients. \n\nOverall, I'll say not your average Indian restaurant, with a wide variety of options I'll need to explore my next time through Arizona. \n\nWord to the wise -- pay in cash and get 10% off!

They bring out different chutneys to dip in the pieces your rip off. Not only was this fun, but it was absolutely delicious! They have many different varieties so step out of your comfort zone and give it a try. We were also impressed with the wide selection of goat dishes. The meat fell right off the bones and the sauces were super rich and flavorful. \n\nAfter polishing off the best mango lassi we've had out here, we were commenting how we couldn't eat another bite...but then Vischu tempted us with a dessert we've never tried.

Don't let their buffet style confuse you, it was also new to me. They bring out the items on the menu as you order them. So it's kind of like \"Tapas\" style dinning rather than a buffet bar where you scoop up your own servings. I actually kind of like this style as I didn't over eat and yet I was fully satisfied.

We were able to pass dishes around with ease so it was like our own family style buffet. \n\nKaren walked us through some options and we started with our fan favorite: Chicken Tikka Masala.  The sauce was flavorful and delicious, we ended up getting 3 helpings of it.  We also tried the Goat Roganjosh which reminded me of a pot roast, very tender meat.  My unexpected favorite was the Chicken Saag - I have never had it before but now I will make sure to order it every time.  We also tried the naan, Makhani Daal and a roasted eggplant puree with spices but I cant remember the name of it.   All the food was well balanced with spices and flavor and the owner and staff were all really friendly.\n\nI love supporting local businesses and if you are in the mood for great Indian food, I would definitely suggest it!

No matter what size glass you give to the guest, a refill is still a refill.\n\nAlso, another con to this place is you basically get \"nickle and dime\"-d. Side sauces like the tamarind sauce, cilantro sauce and raita where you normally get for free at 90% of other Indian restaurants, here you get charged for it. Being in the business, I get where their mentality stems from, but to actually experience it as a paying guest, I abstain from enjoying these condiments here. \n\nFood is nothing to brag about, but for price and convenience of this place being closer than MOST Indian restaurants that I would normally visit, I would still come back.\n\nHey, cheap eats is cheap eats.

However, I immediately had a sinking feeling when we entered the restaurant and noticed that the place was empty. Completely silent! In fact, there was not even a worker or owner present until my uncle whistled, prompting the owner to rush towards us and seated us. After he seated us, I waited a few minutes, and when water didn't show, I felt annoyed that I had to ask for water. It's a restaurant, Jesus Christ ! In addition, I noticed the lack of papadum and the various chutneys I was familiar with receiving at every Indian restaurant I had ever been too. However, I forgave this as maybe things are not the same in Vegas as Los Angeles. On the topic of service, every single item we ordered took absurdly long to prepare, considering we were the ONLY customers present. In fact, one of my uncles had specially ordered a Chana masala without onion and garlic because he doesn't eat that. The item didn't even show up until the rest of us had almost finished eating. \n\nService aside, let's move on to the most important part: quality of food. The vegetable Pakora, the first appetizer, was literally a cauliflower fried in unseasoned batter which was disgusting. Hell, anyone could make better pakoras than what was prepared by Armaan Taste of India. On some pieces, I could see the raw cauliflower which had none of the flavorless batter. Unappetizing much? I decided to clear my mind; perhaps the main dishes would be somewhat decent. Oh boy, was I wrong! The paneer tikka masala tasted like someone had dumped heaps of tomato paste, tomato pur\u00e9e, and chunks of tomato, with sugar and small sprinkles of Indian spices. This was despite my request for extremely spicy paneer tikka masala. The malai kofta gravy tasted like raw sewage diluted with turmeric and chilly power. By far, the most disgusting dish. The channa masala which my uncle had ordered looked like little shit pieces in brown gravy. The next morning, my uncle said he threw up all of the disgusting channa masala. \n\nI presume the high ratings are from non-Indians who don't know how delicious Indian food can be when prepared properly. To you, I suggest visiting restaurants recommended by any Indians you may know.

Food was below average to average.  First of all, the variety seemed rather limited, which is surprising for a buffet.  I'm not at all a vegetarian, but I usually look forward to Indian buffets for the vegetarian choices.  Not so here.  They do have the usual Aloo Gobi (cauliflower dish), Palak Paneer, and the pakoras.  The quality was ok, but nothing special.  As for the meat dishes, the butter chicken rather bland - shocking for butter chicken, I know.  Disappointing :(.  They also had a lamb curry (ok, but not as flavorful as most Indian lamb dishes should be), Chili chicken (actually pretty good!), Chicken vindaloo (average ) and a few other things that I can't remember since they were relatively nondescript.  The price was acceptable.  The decor was typical.  The service was pleasant enough.\n\nI think they just opened - in a way, this means that you can give them the benefit of the doubt.

Hubby had the Lamb Vindaloo which was spicy and really good flavor, red sauce with lots of good spice.  The food is a little spicy, but we like spicy!  One downer is that I had to keep asking for a water refill, instead of them automatically checking in on us.\n\nAlso had the sugarcane drink but it tasted bland, like it was poured out of a can or a gallon, not at all fresh.  \n\nRecently, I was disappointed to find out this restaurant received a D from the county's health service, big turn off for any future return.

Needless to say I kept focused on the main two rows.\n\n  As I feasted on several platefuls of delicious goat roganjosh, spicy 'chicken 65' - sometimes with the butter chicken sauce on top, and some excellent chicken tandoori I was pleased to notice several large Indian families come in to eat - aaalways a good sign. Some more highlights include their great egg curry with glazed onions and mango dahl... \n\n  The recipes carry an authenticity to them... 4/5 stars - Recommended for anyone in the area looking to get some Indian food for lunch. Would give a fifth star for a more competitive price (little high on weekends at $13+ per adult), a slighttlyyy bigger selection, and dinner buffet availability...
