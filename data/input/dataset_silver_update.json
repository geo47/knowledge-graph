Just look at the photo we took (above) Overall, we were pleased. The Kura is a stuffed Indian eggplant, there's a kind of red paste they seem to marinate from the inside, then pan fried. These kind of details I love, gives so much unique flavor. The Chana dish was equally great. Proper spices, and deliciously spicy. I love that they made it proper hot!\n\nThe raita was the only disappointment. Extremely watered out, but I'm not a fan of raw white onions anyway...\n\nNow, the prices are normal I suppose of South Charlotte. It did make me hesitate from eating here, until I open my takeaway bag and realized that two dishes was enough to feed 3, 4 ppl. Huge portions.\n\nWill come here again to try the daily lunch buffet. They also had lots of South indian dishes, like Kerala Fish Curry.

I have to say I've definitely had better Indian food for some reason the taste does seen rather bland for authentic Indian cuisine  I think the chiefs play it safe with the level of spice. Most dishes are delicious it just seems like something is missing for it to be considered real great Indian cuisine. I do not know enough about how to cook Indian food to say exactly what it is. I like the fact that the dishes are not salty, the only time I feel bad from the food is when I eat to much. The tandoori although good seems a little short on flavor, small pieces the butter chicken is quite disappointing it is very rich and doesn't taste \nlike butter chicken I remember from other restaurants, not to mention it has bones in it what a sin. There always seems to be more sauce than chicken.The pieces I thought were quite small. The beef dish is good, the curry goat and chicken not so much the meat on these dishes seems very tough, I think they use the cheapest meat for the buffet. I haven't  tried the dishes on the menu yet bet I assume they are allot better. The veggie dishes seem old like they've been sitting their for days, overall the buffet does not seem to heat the food I have never seen the dishes really hot there not cold just lukewarm. The only hot item is when they bring the Nan bread from the oven. I really wish they had more of those famous  Indian\ndeserts, instead of ice cream which I don't think is sanitary to leave it there and everybody dig in to it and they need to cover it separately as well not just the door. The service unfortunately is not that great either the owner is very friendly, however the waiters seem disengaged like they just want to go home, no small talk no smile nothing. The worst thing for me about being served in a restaurant is when I have to ask for EVERYTHING, I don't mind sometimes but I always have to ask for another drink, more water, napkins remove bottles etc. every single time. The place does give the appearance of being clean especially the washrooms which is one of the reasons I go back. I must say I have seen attitude from some of the staff again not the owner who is always professional. On one occasion a girl working there who I never seen  before or ever since actually spoke rather rudely to me in an unfriendly tone for putting a little sauce back on the buffet dish from my plate OMG Call the police lol. Last thing I want to address is the decor definitely needs an upgrade seating could be set up better to maximize space, the carpet looks old and decrepit and the T.V looks nice but I've never seen it on. I don't think they want to pay for cable and no clock, whats up with that, oh I get it don't let people know what time it is so they won't leave to soon or have another beverage. The thing I hate about the buffet section is there is no light I think it should be the other way around lots of light to see the buffet and less light in the dinning room perhaps candles would make for a better dinning experience, flowers would create ambience, sometimes the music is too loud for dinning.  I think rather than everybody so close to each other in the dinning room they should use the other room as well especially on the weekends where seating is an issue. One more thing, through the week business is petty slow sometimes only me and a few people are there.So why play games with the few customers you have, one time a waiter who is no longer there charged me imported price for domestic beer I brought it to the owner's attention and he adjusted the bill the next time I went, no apologies were given everybody know's Budweiser is domestic duh. Another time I specifically asked for a Canada Dry Ginger Ale and that's the name it is listed as on the menu, the owner brings it to me and life is good. The next one I ordered he brings no name ginger ale I was so angry I just left as soon as I finished the meal I didn't want to lose it. Ant the no name of course tastes like crap that's why its cheap but he still charged me the $2.50. One time the said waiter who is no longer there when I asked him to remove the bottles from the table, he said you have a big table with lots of room. What the hell is he talking to me like that for. Unbelievable this is not how you talk to customers who pay your bills. As you can imagine it was reflected in the tip. Another time they tried to give me a bottle of beer that was opened for days flat as hell, they corrected that when I  spoke up about it.\nLook I'm not saying to avoid this place at all, I just know they could make it a whole lot better.\nI usually go alone and I've noticed the more people the better the service.(the  bigger the tip) By all means check it out the buffet used to be $10.95 they just raised it to $14.95 but the buffet items did not change at all, nothing new added go figure.", "name": "Pierre"}, {"review_id": "r-bA9_SyRS3Z3h5IgMpEgt-A", "user_id": "u-rlqSOqnC4IDP612W2DlYLw", "date": "2013-11-26 19:34:31", "rating": 1.0, "text": "Went there for a Sunday lunch party.

I suspect they use great ingredients and don't make the food taste better by loading it up with fat, it felt actually healthy.  The place was clean, the food was hot, and delicious. Everything from the pickles to gulab jamon were home made. Lots of veggie options and a  few meat options. I was a big fan of the makhni Dahl my wife loved the pakora and butter chicken.

I was actually a little bit skeptical about the place and a little worried that the food will not be that great considering the fact that there are quite a bit of negative comments below me.\n\n\n~THE FOOD\nI am not Indian, so my opinion about the food would probably be subjective.  In my opinion, the food was actually quite tasty. But I feel like the spice of the food was toned down quite a bit to make it a little bit more palatable for non-Indian diners. I like my food VERY SPICY, and I wish I asked for like chilies or something. \n\n- The Butter chicken was good. Even though a buffet, the chicken was not dry. \n- I was afraid that the Tandoori Chicken would be dry but it actually wasn't. It was mostly dark meat but the chicken was not dry at all. \n- They had some Indian style pasta which I thought was quite funny (I whispered to my brother... \"this is for white people\" LOL).\n- The rest of the food? I don't even remember what they were called. I think I had Aloo Gobi or something (Potato/cauliflower curry) but they were all quite tasty.\n\nWhat got me really excited..... UNLIMITED NAAN BREAD, and you don't even have to ask for it. It keeps refilling itself.\n\n\n~SERVICE\nThe servers were quite attentive. We did not have to wait for them to refill our drinks/water. I did not have to ask them to give us more naan bread, they just kept coming. The only time we had to ask them for something was when we needed our bill.\n\n\n~OVERALL EXPERIENCE\nIt was good. It was inexpensive ($14.95 before tax, for dinner) I am sure there are places better than this one. But the fact that it is close to my house and school, I am a happy camper. I definitely would go back here if ever I crave for Indian food.", "name": "Bon'shaniqua"}, {"review_id": "r-_Duu2W4DoDPfSTtwH6HzzQ", "user_id": "u-47R5xhLhoprA8xYkS21x9Q", "date": "2016-03-25 23:33:28", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Came in on a Wednesday night, located in a really shoddy strip mall, lighting was really dark, and we were the ONLY persons in the entire place served by a single lonely guy.

I found that the food was very plain with no salt no spice no  taste,  really to be honest. The decor was  super old an dingy. We were seated by the server at our reserved table,  and then we were offered something to drink. When the waiter came he offered water or pop or alcoholic drinks but he stated instead of getting individual glass of pop, its better to get the jar. Apparently the pop is not free in the buffet, we ended up getting Coke and it was so water down due to all the ice that was thrown in.  We went to grab food and the plates weren't  that clean,  once i found a clean plate. I realized how limited  the food was and there  was hardly any veggie options the meat didn't  taste great either. The food was cold and dry, not not appealing at all.To be honest the butter chicken  I love having and this restaurant butter chicken was horrible the can of  butter chicken sauce  at NoFrills taste better then what they had.  The cart with the food  wasn't even full. Once we ate food  we had to use the same plate to get food again if we wanted seconds. We got free naan at our table and  the tv in the restaurant had black glare so we couldn't really enjoy it and they turned it off half way. The dessert was limited to ice cream which was almost empty, rice pudding and gulabjam  which wasn't that sweet. The waiters almost rushed us out by grabbing our plates once  we were done like they didn't want us to sit and enjoy each others company.

I may be wrong here but I didn't bother to ask since I wasn't going to add another water bottle to the landfill.\nReplace that and I'd give a higher review.", "name": "Randus"}, {"review_id": "r-sThpkEnPvdbF34js3x9RFg", "user_id": "u-FflbpnSuF3POJG_lPdxLlg", "date": "2018-11-04 21:53:41", "rating": 3.0, "text": "Good food, amazing service, poor ventilation in the restaurant so your clothes will need a direct washing when you get home from the restaurant!", "name": "Stephen"}, {"review_id": "r-2qpFyx9Y6CNhhixMu79jHg", "user_id": "u-dsXDA0Dwspk47FFhi3oKvg", "date": "2019-03-26 16:52:36", "rating": 1.0, "text": "went for the lunch buffet on tuesday. arrived at 1145 and the open sign wasnt on but tried the door and it was open. no one greeted me so i chose a booth and went to the buffet line. there were only maybe 5 spots filled. finally at noon the buffet was filled and i got a bit. most of the dishes looked like they were rewarmed from the weekend. the tandoor chicken was pink on the inside and rubbery.

Immediately upon sitting down, the server brought bottled water for each of us. I am talking about the plastic bottled water that you would buy from Harris Teeter!  I have never seen that done before.   Anyway, the three of us ordered a bunch of different dishes and enjoyed sharing the flavors and food items. I think my favorite was the GOBI 65, which was fried cauliflower. It was magnificently prepared with the best spices. The Gobi was preceded by paneer, which is an Indian cheese, cut into square pieces and served with onions and peppers. We also ordered one of the curry dishes and a Ravaa Dosa, which was served with chutney and lentil soup.  The dosa was served flat on the plate, as opposed to the rolled up dosas that I have had in the past.  Finally, we shared some cheese bread.  I can't say enough greats things about the quality of the food and the flavors.   There were two things that we thought could have been better.  The dishes could have been served a little warmer than what they were.  The second thing is that the service was painfully slow.  It took at least 30 minutes for our first dish to be served.  And it stayed slow, all the way til the end of our meal. Perhaps they are undergoing start up pains or perhaps they were understaffed tonight.  No sure.  What I will remember is the how my palette jumped up and down with each bite.   There is a bar in the restaurant, but the emphasis seems to be on beer and wine. The atmosphere is light and quiet, which worked perfectly for us.   If they speed up the service and warm up the food just a tad, this place will be a winner in the Ballantyne area!

Everything had enough spice to make you crave more and not too much to make you cry...just enough for a nice head sweat if you eat too fast (you know what i mean)\n\nand when were were STUFFED, my wife decided on dessert...and she picked the mango and what looked like little flapjacks with a sugary pudding...And it turns out the sugary stuff was the best dessert i've tasted since lava cakes came into existence.  It was a form of bread pudding that i cannot describe other than \"PLEASE HAVE MORE\" i wish i could remember the name but it was purely amazing.  \n\nAll in all, EXCELLENT staff, great service, food was hot and spicy and just out of this world.

I really enjoyed trying all of the dips and spreads and figuring out what I loved and what I still haven't acquired a taste for. In addition to the buffet, there are Dosa menus on the tables for you to basically order bottomless, made-to-order Dosas.

They primarily focus on chicken, beef, fish, and shrimp but also offer a variety of noodle, rice, and vegetarian dishes. Most of the dishes are wet and saucy ie. their chili dishes, mango dishes, sweet and spicy, sweet and sour dishes are heavily marinated with sauces and stir-fried onions. If you are looking for something dry however, I highly recommend the Tangra-Villa Meat dishes. \n\nTo say Tangra is flavourful is an understatement. With every bite I can taste the garlic, the spices, the onions, and the parsley used in the seasoning. This is definitely an upgrade from the typical garlic and soy sauce dressing in other local Chinese restaurants.\n\nThe lady manning the phone was polite, the portion sizes were fair, and the overall takeout experience was pretty great. For around $22 tax included, my family of four was stuffed with enough leftovers for lunch the next day.

Not only does the mango not taste like real mango, the lassi came out way sweeter than any I've had and probably sweeter than any proper lassi you'd find in India. In a similar vein, the food was OK, but it was missing the potency so signature of Indian spice, that fragrance that's supposed to envelop you when at Indian restaurants. Where is the meaty grilledness in the tandoori chicken? Where is that earthy cumin in your samosa? Everything just tasted kind of...impotent.

But the service today was REALLY BAD! A coworker of mine ordered a chicken wrap, i know for a fact that she ordered chicken since she was young she never ate BEEF because of her religion so there is no way in hell that she will ever order BEEF. So she got her wrap and she started eating it. Since its a wrap unless you disassemble it you would not know by the looks of it whether it was red or white meat inside so she took a bite and ate it. Never in her life she tasted beef so she ask us taste it since it tasted weird for her. So we disassembled the wrap at this point and tasted the meat inside it. It was beef!!!!! At that point my coworker talked to the cashier and informed her that instead of giving her chicken, she gave her beef. Instead of apologizing, she raised her voice to my coworker and told her she made a mistake on her order which was not true at all. Unfortunately  we don't have a proof since the receipt just says lunch special. She did not apologized , she did not even offer to give her a replacement. At this point my coworker even though clearly upset but hungry  ordered another chicken wrap despite us telling her not to do it and we can just transfer to another restaurant. I was well tempted to just really make a scene but We don't want to stoop down to her level. The 5 of us and all other people that we know of swear never again to go back to this restaurant!  I understand that the reason that the cashier would have not  admitted her mistake was that it might end up that she foot the bill. But what I don't understand is why she needs to raise her voice to my coworker.   A simple hint of humility could have been ok. If there is 0 stars, i will definitely give this place that.

I've lived all over the country, and have had Indian enough to know ... \"good from great\". Soma Grill is truly \"great\" food. I've been to this place with my husband over a dozen times and we'll keep coming back. \n\nWhy, you ask? \n\nWell, the answer is simple. The food is hand made every day, the staff is full of heart and spirt, and the owner is a wonderful woman who truly cares about her guests.\n\nHere's some things I'd like to brag about eating there:\n\nStart with the:\nVegetable Samosa's (comes with an order of two and two dipping sauces) - these triangular delights are a perfect way to start your meal. The green dipping sauce is perfectly spicy and compliments the brown sweet dipping sauce. YUM!!!\n \nFor dinner we share. Here's what we love there ... but first, you must know dinner comes with a cup of mildly spicy and delicious lentil soup, as well as a fresh salad. The salad has a zesty yogurt dressing lightly garnishing the top of it. Now for the main course.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala (this comes in a light red/orange cream sauce) The chicken is tender and the sauce has a bold rich tomato flavor. Mmmmm ... Get the Naan to dip in this sauce so no drop goes to waste. \n\nLamb Kashmiri (this has a mild burgandy sauce with almonds in it) The lamb tastes like it has been cooking all day. If you've ever had \"osso bucco\" from an Italian restaurant ... you know that succulent meat that falls off the bone. This lamb is as tender as that. AND the sauce, it has a ton of flavor. If you eat lamb this is something you must try. \n\nFish (Cod) Madras (this is perfectly cooked white fish in a very fresh rich colored tomato sauce with onions and mushrooms) What I really like about this dish is how much it complements the heavier flavors in the tikka massala's cream sauce. \n\nIf you're looking for a vegetable dish my husband and I have tried a few of them. Our favorite is the \"Aloo Gobi\" \n\nAloo Gobi (this dish has potato's and cauliflower mixed in a light, fresh crushed tomato sauce) It's very good and a nice compliment to all the meat dishes we order  to share. \n\nWe've had both the garlic and regular naan. They're perfect for dipping, and in my opinion, naan is a \"must have\" when eating an Indian meal. \n\nRice comes with the meals, so if you don't want bread but want a starch, you'll be happy to know white rice accompanies all entrees. \n\nAs for dessert we've had the rice pudding and pistachio ice-cream (this is the kulfi) on the menu. Between those two, I'd pick the pistachio ice-cream every time. It's very refreshing after a hot meal. \n\nAlso, each time we visit I always get the hot chai tea. This milky goodness is made to order and is worth the wait. You add the sugar which puts you in the drivers seat, as far as sweetness goes.\n\nI recommend Soma Grill to anyone looking to try something other than a chain restaurant. This food is worth a try and if you already like Indian food take my dinner suggestions. You won't be sorry! \n\nHope this helps -- Enjoy!", "name": "Malinda"}, {"review_id": "r-s6yZiTquKMnEwBUOgnXkWA", "user_id": "u-tLb-WQFc2fHo5MgF4DwSVw", "date": "2012-01-08 18:32:17", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Nice little hole-in-the-wally sort of place, with the feeling of a family owned neighborhood joint mainly patronized by locals.

As for the Chaplee Kabob, it was my first time trying this dish. I liked the marinade and the meat was cooked perfectly, but it was quite oily...\n\nThe salad is always fresh and I love the Afghani bread (especially dipped in both the sauces). For about $2 more, you can get a dinner platter which comes with quite a bit of basmati rice. \n\nWatan Kabob has a fairly straightforward ordering system. You just have to order and pay at the counter, then wait until your number is called. \n\nIt can be quite busy, even on a weeknight, packed with families and children playing hide-and-seek behind you. \n\nWatan Kabob is very similar to Bamiyan Kabob (I read in an earlier review that the owner of Watan Kabob used to work there). However, it differs from a restaurant with waiter service, an extensive menu, and more comfortable seating, like Paramount. Unfortunately, Watan Kabob does not make the thick garlic sauce that Paramount offers, but I enjoyed the food at Watan Kabob more and the menu is more reasonably priced.

If I had to recommend one must-try it would be the malai kofta; rich, exotic, expertly seasoned- top notch. I lived in Japan for many years and the Indian restaurants there are out of this world, authentic and very different from what you find in the states.

I was pretty pleased they had many more veg items compared to 4 non-veg dishes. I the never seen a veg biriyani being part of buffet. It was always chicken biriyani. So my non-veg friends were not too pleased with this. They had a paneer pulao so I would suggest to replace that with a non-veg rice item. For me the highlight was Aloo Bonda and the fried baby corn.

I could eat that stuff like popcorn, very tasty. \n\nFor entrees, we got Kadai Chicken, tender chunks in a medium-spice tomato based sauce (not the sort of thing I'd usually order, but there's a great variety there, and it was delish); and the old standby Saag Paneer, which is often sort of bland, but this was quite spicy, and it made me wonder why everyone doesn't serve it so fiery? Fantastic. \n\nAdded some garlic naan, which was a little thinner than I'm used to, but that was an interesting change. For drinks, they had some summer specials that were very unusual to our palates -- mine was a faintly salty lemonade, my wife had a mint cooler.

However, I immediately had a sinking feeling when we entered the restaurant and noticed that the place was empty. Completely silent! In fact, there was not even a worker or owner present until my uncle whistled, prompting the owner to rush towards us and seated us. After he seated us, I waited a few minutes, and when water didn't show, I felt annoyed that I had to ask for water. It's a restaurant, Jesus Christ ! In addition, I noticed the lack of papadum and the various chutneys I was familiar with receiving at every Indian restaurant I had ever been too. However, I forgave this as maybe things are not the same in Vegas as Los Angeles. On the topic of service, every single item we ordered took absurdly long to prepare, considering we were the ONLY customers present. In fact, one of my uncles had specially ordered a Chana masala without onion and garlic because he doesn't eat that. The item didn't even show up until the rest of us had almost finished eating. \n\nService aside, let's move on to the most important part: quality of food. The vegetable Pakora, the first appetizer, was literally a cauliflower fried in unseasoned batter which was disgusting. Hell, anyone could make better pakoras than what was prepared by Armaan Taste of India. On some pieces, I could see the raw cauliflower which had none of the flavorless batter. Unappetizing much? I decided to clear my mind; perhaps the main dishes would be somewhat decent. Oh boy, was I wrong! The paneer tikka masala tasted like someone had dumped heaps of tomato paste, tomato pur\u00e9e, and chunks of tomato, with sugar and small sprinkles of Indian spices. This was despite my request for extremely spicy paneer tikka masala. The malai kofta gravy tasted like raw sewage diluted with turmeric and chilly power. By far, the most disgusting dish. The channa masala which my uncle had ordered looked like little shit pieces in brown gravy. The next morning, my uncle said he threw up all of the disgusting channa masala. \n\nI presume the high ratings are from non-Indians who don't know how delicious Indian food can be when prepared properly. To you, I suggest visiting restaurants recommended by any Indians you may know. Once you visit a proper Indian restaurant, you will agree with my review and agree with how an abomination of a restaurant Armaan Taste of India is.", "name": "Hello"}, {"review_id": "r-HYW87hBE0kiJon3DNVPtJw", "user_id": "u-e0KcqeKhCnwL1UZRGLv6_Q", "date": "2018-10-15 00:31:01", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Really good food with really good flavors.

The Gulab Jamoons were torn apart in the buffet tray and not even a single intact piece was there. The tandoori chicken tray was empty. They did not care to refill the empty food trays.

The chef needs to know that Indian food needs salt . Food tastes like Indian hospital food if theresn't any salt.  I heard another person complain as well when I entered.. So am not alone.\nb. When this restaurant had a different owner , I thought I saw better ambiance inside.. Right now there is a mirror that is about it.. Just plain walls everywhere.. Booths did look very small and we didn't try it anyways. Interestingly , there was no music either ..\nc. Sambar is supposed to be a mix of Tamarind water, spices, Dal and vegetables like onion. In here only the first ingredient was present.\nd. When we entered , the Naan tray was empty. When I tried twice later on, they were empty. When I left , they were empty. The owner or manager was right there. But there wasnt sufficient Naan at all. I left without even having an opportunity to taste Naan. My wife who was fortunate to get one piece said it was good.\nc. Andhra Chicken was ok and so was the egg curry. Butter chicken tasted very dry and with no spice.\nd. What is up with the vegetarian choices - egg plant curry and zucchini curry.. Can u not come up with better choices for Sunday buffet?\ne. The served bottle water which was good but food should be good too which was absent.\nf. I thought the menu said vegetable biryani. I only saw colored rice. Didnt taste like Biryani.\ng. Food felt fresh as the website claimed . Only the chef needs to learn to cook better.\nh. I wouldnt go there for dinner . The owner needs to add some interiors to this restaurant otherwise it would compete only with the C-Fu next door instead of being a restaurant for dinner.\n\nI would revisit to give them a fair chance at dinner this month..

The butter paneer was really good- but I regret not taking the rice as a base- since I was so rushed to order.\n\nThe bhel puri (not on online menu)- or indian trail mix that comes with puffy baked rice grains, peanuts, fried spicy dough bits, and salad toppings mixed in with a sweet and spicy tamarind sauce was a solid dish. Don't keep this for leftovers because it won't taste as good.\n\nThe butter chicken poutine (10$)- my favorite dish-I was disappointed there weren't real french fries but more so potato wedges. The portion was huge! but french fries would really make a difference.\n\n The mango lassi was so nice to have alongside all this food. All this food fed 3 people and cost less than 50$ total.

All were absolutely delicious and the husband devoured his butter chicken bro bowl. I was extremely satisfied with my channa samosa - It was served impeccably with just the right amount of chickpea curry and crunch and topped with pomegranates - perfection! \nAll the 'bowl' foods are made in front of you, like a sandwich/salad bar but the naans are made fresh at the back so we received ours a little later.

They were great with refills and prompt delivery of our food (and also patience with the fact that we food blogger types have to take pictures of everything before we eat it).\n\nThey do have a wine list, and while it's small, it's also relatively cheap.  The bottles were all less than $30 each, and we got a nice shiraz to go with our dinner.\n\nWe started with the samosas, which were quite good, but standard, and then, in a flash of greatness, the words 'vegetable chat' caught my eye on the menu.\n\nVegetable chat is this thing that I love, that I've never known the name of.  It's a cold almost-salsa-like dish made up of chickpeas, potatoes, onions, and Indian seasonings, then topped with crunchy crackers (the same consistency and flavor of the samosa shell), yogurt, and tamarind sauce.  It's like a less-mayonnaise-d version of potato salad.  Oh, how I love it!  Star of India's was absolutely perfect, and I'm so glad I took a chance on ordering it.\n\nHowever, not wanting to step totally out of my comfort zone, I ordered my typical mattar paneer.  It was good, and not a huge portion, so I didn't feel compelled to just keep eating and eating the deliciousness in front of me.\n\nMy husband got the tandoor mixed grill, which had chicken, shrimp, and lamb.  He was crazy about it.  Like most Indian restaurants, you can pick the level of spice for each entree.  The garlic naan was ridiculously puffy and buttery, which we loved.\n\nWe will definitely return to Star of India.  It's much more low-key than India Garden, but the food is just as good.  If you want a nice, laid-back place to have a bottle of wine and some tasty Indian food, check this restaurant out.

I was not seated at one of the tables next to the buffet, otherwise my review would have been 2 stars... \nThe food is not the best, lamb is mostly bones, cheese (paneer) not creamy, naan not fresh, too much mayo in the coleslaw salad.\nThe staff not very friendly (or too busy), they don't refill dishes half an hour before the buffet closes (even if they take new guests). Nobody asked me if I want something from the bar. \nOnly few options for cold starters and deserts. (I am comparing with Kama, which is not far away).\nThe restaurant looks like a foodcourt, a big room with lots of light and square tables.

Even though they have expanded to another location in Scarborough, so that there are now two Silver Spoons, the Pickering location has managed to maintain consistent quality, although it can vary on days.\nWell, what restaurant doesn't have that problem? You might be suddenly short-staffed (someone down with the flu), or perhaps one of your deliveries didn't make it on time? \nIt is good food. I prefer the Pakistani cuisine: Nihari, Haleem (not always available) and several of the biryanis. They are now offering Sindhi Biryani on weekends, and I'm so pleased! The only way that I could get that in the past was to make it myself using a packaged spice blend. \nIf you want to get Naan, I recommend the Butter Naan. Although it costs a bit more, the butter enhancements really take the Naan to the next level of browning and savoury tastes. Ok, things sit under the heat lamp, but they do not seem to suffer that much (particularly something like Nihari, which is a stew-type dish that can withstand the warming table. Everything has always tasted fresh when I have ordered it.\nI find that the samosas are fairly standard, but there are other appetizers which are more exciting. For people who like the dark meat of the chicken, Lollypop Chicken is great and consistently good. I also enjoy Shami Kabab. If you like fish, don't skip the Fingerfish, which is consistently tasty.\nWhenever I have been there, which is perhaps once a month or two, for the past five years, the portions have been generous.\nI am certainly a fan, and the Silver Spoon fills an important niche in the local, Pickering community as a convenient place to pick up some Halal take-away of decent quality.", "name": "Katya"}, {"review_id": "r-NLaGpX4hCMraZ9OukN0AnQ", "user_id": "u-Uaqawx2iD0mT5YP_akJrJw", "date": "2014-06-27 00:28:47", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Oh, Silver Spoon. I've tried to love you. I've given you so many chances. \n\nBut this just isn't working out anymore.\n\nTo start: the food isn't exactly terrible. It's just...not very good. I've tried almost every meat dish, the chana masala, samosas, biriyanis, etc. Indian take-out is hardly known for its healthiness, but when you order a veal karahi and get two sad chunks of meat floating in half a container in oil, it's a little disheartening. Add to that the fact that food is often sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long...\n\nOn the upside: the chicken biriyani is good bang for your buck - especially during the week when it's on special. You get a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat. It's ready to go, so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for your order. There was that one time they ran out of chicken biriyani (which is understandable when it's on special) but then offered me a \"regular biriyani\" (read: JUST rice) for the same price. Ummm, say what?\n\nI do love their beef samosas - it's just to bad that they NEVER HAVE ANY. Seriously, I have been here early in the evening, at random times during the week, and they have loads of sad looking veggie samosas, but no beef. I feel like the owners need to do a serious evaluation of what works and doesn't work. If you notice you're always selling out of a certain item (and NOT another), doesn't it make sense to up that portion while downsizing another? Who knows.\n\nMy biggest gripe was the chana masala incident.\nThe last time I went in, I ordered a chana masala (which I'm apathetic about, but my husband likes). The girl at the counter kind of made a face and said, \"Oh...no. You don't want that.\" I was confused. There was a whole tray of it there, brimming with chick-pea goodness. \"It's not...good today.\" \n\nWhat? What does that mean? Is the taste just 'off' or had it spoiled? In either event, why is there a full tray of \"not good\" chana masala here for customers to look at (and possible walk out the door with)? I stared at the tray, and she motioned at it again, \"I was just going to remove it from here anyway.\"\n\nBut, um, you didn't. And I was the only person in the store. From the wide glass window, before I even stepped in, I could see that there was no one else even there. She hadn't even come over until I'd been standing there for a few minutes. \n\nIt really bothers me that I still really don't know what was so wrong with an entire tray of food that it would warrant being thrown out - and why it HADN'T been thrown out immediately if it really couldn't be saved. It was clear from the crispiness on the top (you know, that kind of layer of 'skin' that develops?) that it had been sitting for a while. Ultimately, I'm really quite relieved the staff person told me before I bought it, took it home and got diarrhea or something (this would be a much harsher review if that had happened...) And I guess that says something positive about the customer service (sorta...)\n\nAs more and more Indian food places - both takeout and dine-in - emerge in the region, store owners need to realize that customers are going to eventually become more discerning. I really wanted this place to be a favorite - after all, it's very convenient for me - but, sorry, Silver Spoon, you just don't make the cut.", "name": "Heli"}, {"review_id": "r-ZAmkMWTSbWQRO-uEzYmR8g", "user_id": "u-pj7M1RIWV0caCp7Kj91JxA", "date": "2014-12-17 03:39:34", "rating": 3.0, "text": "They do not have lots of crowd and it taste is different than other locations.

I've been going to the one in parc extension about a decade ago and even though I lived downtown I would do the drive to go there. However , not too long ago , I was very excited that they had opened a location downtown . To my disappointment , this place did not live up to expectation. The service is extremely slow here and every time I've been here I've had some issue with the front end of the house. The food is good, hence why I gave 2 stars but the service makes this place unbearable. The employees don't seem to care at all about their customers and sometimes stand around and talk to each other while you're there waiting to be served. I'm quite easy going and the first time It had happened , it was right after their lunch break , I was a bit in a hurry but it was fine I get it people need breaks. I didn't speak out on a bad review just yet because I didn't feel like it was representative of what they were capable of. There were other incidents too. However , yesterday was the final draw. We had called for pick up and the lady said 20 minutes and the food would be ready. We took precautions and showed up 25-30 minutes after the call. To our disappointment , we ended up waiting another 25 minutes idled on St-Catherine which is really not the most ideal. Overall , food is good if you're willing to put up with bad service.", "name": "Dave"}, {"review_id": "r-WcwpJD2WLTrYbfh4iPdZMg", "user_id": "u-eZQmVZZAKCzayXTf3W99YA", "date": "2019-02-17 03:16:46", "rating": 1.0, "text": "I'm giving this 1 star because I can't rate less.

If anyone has ever tasted the Lolas beef tips it is also close as you get to original Portuguese cuisine.\n\nNow about Nirvana 2;- it is more about carrying out than dining in. Once you set that expectation you would be fine. Another thing to keep in mind is that not all Indian food is spicy. Anything that involves cream will be bland for the most part.

I only bought two meals worth knowing I should have purchased more and I really should have. \n\nI never go Uptown so my first trip to Nirvana was anything but \"Nirvana\". I wasted most my lunch break roaming around uptown, now on foot looking for the restaurant. It is neatly tucked away in some building on MLK blvd, not really S Tryon, which is probably what caused all my confusion. \n\nBut alas I made it! For my first trip I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala with a side of curried potatoes and eggplant. The Chicken was awesome, the tikka masala was very mild which was nice since the potatoes and egg plant was quite spicy. \n\nI went again today ordering the Chicken Tikka Masala again, the chili chicken or pepper chicken looked great but my stomach has been sensitive to spicy lately, hope that passes.The sides were Aloo Bhindi (potato/okra), Navratan Korma and I got a mango lassi. This all came out to ten dollars, I swear it was pushing five pounds of food. I should have weighed it once I got back to the office. The chicken once again was great, korma was mildly spiced and the pineapple really made it stand out. But the aloo bhindi is what I was excited about the most. I had no idea Okra was a big deal out of the south east, probably because my mid western GF had never heard of it. It was very good, almost tasted like the same spices from the eggplant/potato curry but not as spicy.\n\nFor someone who has recently discovered a love for Indian food and by recently I mean six months, I enjoyed Nirvana II.

Gone were the friendly owners, replaced by a new crop of much younger, less interested employees.  I can recall on not once, but at least 2 to 3 occassions going here shortly after 11am for an early lunch and the place was closed.  I've walked in at 11:30 am and they're still setting up? \n\nPrices went up, small changes to the menu items started showing up and the coma-inducing, extra scoops of food that really defined the value of their offering started to wane.  In other words, now you're getting too much food (instead of WAYYY too much food) for $9, instead of $8.  Subtle - but impactful to the discerning lunch goer.  \n\nOne correctable, subtle issue that popped up, and still persists today as I pull another one out of my mouth while chewing and writing this review, is exhibited by the fact that they cook with in-tact, full-sized Cardamom pods and cloves.  Now in and of itself, this is not at all an issue, and in fact encouraged as the subtle flavors are a terrific layer of flavor.  The problem exists when the pods and cloves are not removed prior to serving the dish and so you'll occassinally get a mouthfull of surprise when you bite into an entire Cardamom pod which can simply destroy your pallette for the next several minutes.  It's a rookie mistake, that can be easily changed and make a subtle improvement to their quality.  \n\nUnfortunately, after some serious evaluation of this place for several weeks, if not months (yea I still come here pretty much weekly because it's the closest place to my office) I can no longer recommend this place to folks who may have an Indian food itch burning in their appetites.   The subtle changes that the Aroma management team has made have deteriorated the overall offering beyond my comfort zone.  In fact, the line out the door that used to exist for Nirvana II is gone - the people have spoken!!  \n\nThe other factor here is that Persis Biriyani opened up a place across the street in the Latta Arcade.  In another month or so, after they work out the kinks, I would expect Persis to crush this place on every facet of their offering.

It is nearly a 4...Overall, I really enjoy Indian food and have had it in so many places around the world including Delhi and Bangalore.  \n\nHere is what I like:\n\na. Fast - During lunch, most of the food in their special lunch menu is already prepared and kept warm, so getting your food is very fast.\n\nb.  Selection - Very simple and clear cut. All types of curry and spice levels that you would want.\n\nc.  The ambiance - Very utilitarian in decor, design and feeling. I don't mind it, but it is on the very inexpensive mode, unlike other restaurants.\n\nd.  The food - The most important aspect. I love lamb so we ordered the Lamb Vindaloo.  This is my second time ordering this dish.  The first order time we came here, the Lamb Vindaloo was very mild.  This second time, I asked for it to be hotter and they said it naturally was going to be anyway.   I do admit, the spice was just right and the lamb was very tasty.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was okay, not too inspiring  We also had the Alloo Goobi and this was good, So three dishes between us two.  The naan bread is darn good.  The food is generally pretty decent!\n\ne.  Service - Top notch and will help you to order what you want. Excellent service!\n\nf.  Why not 5 star? I am not sure.  Is it the paper plates?  Is it the fast foodiness style of the restaurant?  Is it the utilitarian feel or the fact that when I am there it is generally empty? Not sure.  \n\nThe food here is good, the lamb I feel is awesome and I will be coming back for sure.\n\nGK says, check it out!

One of my friend recommended this location to me and said that food is cooked in front of you and the prices are reasonable. I bookmarked this location on Yelp and I finally went for it one day.\n\nIts located on a plaza by 215 and Eastern. This area is always busy with many restaurants in the location, so parking might be a small issue. The restaurant is not lavish like many other Indian restaurants, they have TV where some Indian music is played but over all its atmosphere is more like  Roberto's. The owners are Nepalese, and the food is mainly north Indian with some that have obvious Nepalese fusion to it. \n\nI always get two curries, naan and basmati rice at this location. So far I have tried Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Panner (Spinach w/ cottage cheese, my fav.), Chilli Chicken, Chicken Karai, and their Garlic Naan. I think this restaurant has the most authentic Indian flavor of any restaurant and the food is cooked fresh in front of you. \n\nThis prices are also very low compared to Taj and Mint. and its an excellent place for take out meals. When i first went to this restaurant, they were running a promotion of 20% off the entire bill for only month of March. This made the deals even more special. I also saw that they do deliveries now. \n\nI highly recommend that you stop by to try out their sampler plates (Thali) which come with 1-2 entrees and 1-3 side dishes.

Granted, we only used Tandoori Grill's services for take-out (thank God!) but after my experience with them, I swore never to set foot in the actual establishment.\n\nWe ordered the food rather smoothly. However, the restaurant immediately called back to chastise us for ordering one naan, instead of two. In any case, we waited for one hour and a half for our order. The restaurant is 2 miles away, and restaurant promised our order in 40 minutes. Alas, the food arrived....and it was lukewarm....two dishes we ordered were missing, substituted by two other dishes we did not order.....worst thing? The food was not very good.\n\nAfter complaining to the owner of the establishment, he agreed to refund us our money. He requested that we box up delivered dishes and he would come by to pick them up...needless to say, as with the rest of his actions, he screwed up this part as well.\nWe waited until 11 PM for him, and after exchanging half-dozen phone calls, it became clear that he got hopelessly lost and increasingly frustrated. So....we never got our refund.\nThe summary? Tandoori Grille got $70 plus tip and delivery for the tasteless food we did not order... and we spent $70 on the inedible meal and a wasted evening dealing with incredibly rude business owner who somehow felt it was our fault we received the wrong order.\nMy advice:\n1. Please AVOID Tandoori Grill at all costs.\n2. If you absolutely must order froim them....lower your expectations!\n3. Check your order before paying delivery guy....\n4.

We ordered beef samosas for appetizers. The pastry was crispy and flakey and the filling was perfectly seasoned. We wanted more but had to save room for the main course. Next we ordered a meat and veggie curry (chicken masala and blank lentil curry) with both garlic and butter naan (personally, they taste similar so if you're pinching pennies just go for the butter naan).

I get bummed because they used to have butter chicken in the lunch buffet, but now it's always chicken tiki masala. It's okay, but I like the butter chicken more.

All of the dishes seem very chunky and stew-like, different from the sauce or cream mixture type dishes I've seen before with indian food.

The tikka masala is good, that's the only think I liked that I tried, but they use green bell pepper for some reason and I don't think that's what a traditional tikka masala uses. The chicken vindaloo was gross and had some gritty substance in it, possibly a piece of bone, I dunno. And the meat seems to be of a low quality.

I also tried the tandoori chicken, which has a good flavor, but with all the fat and bone on the meat, actually equated to very few ounces of protien. Naan is good, but I've noticed it tends to be burnt slightly most of the time, which maybe they do on purpose but I don't really think improves the flavor of it. This place is ok for the tikka masala but if you're looking for really good Indian food there are better places. I think this place just happens to do alright as it is one of the only places in the west Valley with indian food and so we settle for it because it's close", "name": "Anon"}, {"review_id": "r-msyjYck3aEPytJEZHy11vg", "user_id": "u-hH2Xc-0QBu9mztsrGYSZkg", "date": "2016-08-05 05:57:47", "rating": 5.0, "text": "India garden has great customer service and a delicious set of options on their menu.

The paneer was breaded which I wasn't used to, but I guess that's how it is - didn't deter me from enjoying every firm and faintly cheesy bite.

(On a side note, I think M Resort does modern with more grace than Aria.) I had wanted to try Mantra Masala because it is featured on lvvegan.com (great resource for you Las Vegan vegans), and because it was on the way, we stopped in. \n\nMy theory is that Mantra is hoping that there are some Indian-food lovers within a 3-mile radius who don't want to venture far. If that were me, then I would be pleased with the offerings. We had dal, dewane handi and naan. The dal was more tomato-y than varieties I have experienced, but the flavors and spice levels were solid. (We asked for hotter than \"white people hot\", and they interpreted that nicely.)\n\nThe naan was fine, not spectacular. \n\nHowever, the real disappointment were the prices, especially given the mouse-sized portion of rice that comes with an entree. While $30 for 2 is not an expensive dinner, when you are staring at an entree, a side, a peck of rice and a basket of naan, you start to fantasize about the $19 for 2 spread you could be noshing on at the Namaste buffet. \n\nAnd, although we were not there for lunch, they gave us a lunch special menu to look over. There was one under $6, but it is only rice and one entree. No buffet. No deal. I truly wonder how an Indian restaurant can neglect the beauty of a lunch buffet. It is the only buffet I will eat.\n\nIn closing, if you are within walking distance to Mantra Masala, it is probably the best food you could walk to, which might sound like an insult, but I mean it is a 3-star compliment.", "name": "Misti"}, {"review_id": "r-lkFU-IGHwvnfMfM75WNEzg", "user_id": "u-Ig4SpbxDIZwkQR2IPxxnLw", "date": "2016-05-21 02:37:13", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Everything we had here was good.

After a few search from fellow yelpers I decided that Mantra Masala is exactly where I need to be.  Luckily I managed to kidnap 2 buddies of mine to help me \"experiment\" a little bit more since this was my second time ever having Indian food. \n\nBoth my friends were new to Indian food as well I figured I'd order the Mantra's Mixed Grill which consist of most of their specialties for everyone to share; Tandoori chicken, Chicken Tikka, Bazari Chicken, and Barah Kabab (lamb).  All of which were pretty tender and spiced really well.  \n\nOur server looked at us if like that wasn't enough, so I asked him to recommend us another dish to which he concluded that we should try the Chicken Tikka Masala. OMGggg this stuff was amazing!!  I didn't know this, but this is exactly what i've been looking for!! Not Curry! Spiced, boneless chicken roasted in clay oven, cooked in creamy tomato sauce.  I wanted to call my mom and cry because it was so darn good! ;(\nThere were plenty of sauce left that we dipped our Garlic Nan (leavened bread baked with fresh chopped garlic) into it, poured some over rice, and also dipped some of the Mantra's Mixed Grilled stuff into it as well :X\n\nI could see why he wanted us to order the 2nd dishes because the portion were not that big at all.  Just enough which is perfect because we don't need to stuff ourselves with too much goodness.  A tad bit pricier, BUT over at Mantra Masala it's clear that they implement the philosophy's \"quality over quantity.\"\n\nGood stuff all around.. nom nom nom", "name": "Mike"}, {"review_id": "r-gs2bupHiniDqeUyKEW0b4Q", "user_id": "u-ybcBGlRG0qYHI9DbXjfznA", "date": "2009-03-08 21:03:46", "rating": 1.0, "text": "The food I've tried is so/so but nice decor and the owner and staff are very friendly.  \n\nThe naan can be hit or miss here.

Vindaloo is not great, in fact most of their curries (like the Mantra Masala) taste alike just different heat levels.  Have tried the tandoor mixed grill and it was satisfactory.  The malai kofta is decent but the gravy is more like a soup.  \n\nAlso, one thing I noticed about this place is that the dishes are consistently underseasoned.  I read somewhere that most Americans consider Indian food to be salty so maybe this is an overreaction to that?  Not sure.

A separate cold bar had all the fixings, like a simple salad, mango chutney, raita, rice pudding. There was even a small case of chocolate, vanilla, mango, and strawberry ice cream/sherbet. The best part - everything was great! The naan went fast and was gone by the time we went to the buffet, so the waiter/host brought us a fresh serving from the kitchen. Out of this world!

You could tell that Rajiv loves his restaurant and his job. He made us feel welcome and answered all our questions about the food and restaurant (and the silly Canadian HST tax).\n\nThe next night, we ended up at Bombay Palace again - this time for dinner. Instead of a buffet, we ordered from the menu and were completely blown away. The chicken tikka masala was savory with the perfect balance of onions, tomatoes, and green peppers. My chicken korma was the best I've ever had. Not too sweet, not too creamy, and a wonderful hint of coconut and ginger. The chicken was moist and plentiful. Just thinking about it makes me want to go back to Toronto. At lunch the day before, Rajiv urged us to try the garlic naan. We were so full that we didn't, so we ordered it at this dinner. Words cannot describe the deliciousness of that bread. Most places use too much garlic and overpower the naan; not Bombay Palace.

The pappadams, served with a thick sweet and sour dipping sauce as well as tiny cubes of pickled carrots were a nice little on-the-house appetizer. The pleasantly aromatic navratna korma ($8.95) which I had expected to feature chunks of freshly cooked vegetables disappointingly consisted of only frozen corn, peas, and diced carrots. The saag paneer ($9.95) was as pleasingly thick and richly spinachy as the best with large, creamy cubes of paneer throughout. The non-stretchy naan ($2.50) and the fluffy basmati rice ($4.95) were just okay.\n\nAlthough new bottles of Kingfisher beer ($5.25) were quick to be brought and water refills constant, we were also charged for an extra iced tea that was ordered, but never arrived. \n\nThere were two stalls in the women's bathroom of which neither door locked properly.

My favourite was the coconut chutney because the tomato chutney was too spicy for me. And the potato curry was really simple and delicious. My friend had a upama (hope I am spelling that right) with the sambar and curries however that dosa could have been bigger I guess. It tasted good though, but should have been bigger. Okay so, after the main course, we had pineapple kesari, which was very very yummy. I like simple dishes with top notch quality. Really wins my heart.

Here are the top reasons to go there (I am a vegetarian - so cannot comment on the meat dishes )...\n\n1) Food tastes like homemade, tasty and piping hot. Can be requested spicy which is the way I like it\n\n2) Unbelievable value for money. Anyone who has eaten Indian food in other places in the valley and other cities in US know that to get really good Indian food, you have to pay $$$. Not here. Vegitarian thali's are $6 to $8 (fancier menu). I DO NOT EAT BUFFETS. My personal feeling is like Buffet's are just a huge quality compromise.\n\n3) Food is healthy. I have been eating here since 1999 and not had a bad stomach or any other issues. Like I said dinners are served hot and fresh...\n\nPoints that some people might not like:\n\n1) Owner sometimes looks like he has the burden of the world on him, very sad...\n\n2) Ambience is average as it goes, not something that you look forward to.\n\n3) Very casual atmosphere, so sometimes, we find multiple tables dirty and we just find a good spot and fill water ourselves...Treat it like home.\n\n4) Bollywood songs/videos/programs are telecast. Some people come just for that, and others just sit with their backs to the TV, simple solution.\n\nBut as I am moving out of Phx to Austin, I find that I will miss Kohinoor the most.

We are Asian & know Indian food very well. Big disappointment. Bland, tasteless food. There was no spice or taste. I give it 1 star for many reasons. First let me tell you, I am not one to write reviews, unless I am very impressed with a business or thoroughly disappointed.\nI called the owner earlier in the evening, as I wanted to purchase a Groupon for the Buffet. The Groupon was for 2, 4 or 6 people. We were 3, my husband, myself & My Mum. So I asked her about it as I wanted to know if they offered a Senior citizens discount, so that we could buy the Groupon for the both of us & pay for my Mum.\nShe then told me, that I need not buy the Groupon & that I could come in & she would give me the Groupon price for all three, with drinks included. (that would have been $5 per person for the Dinner buffet.) So I was happy with that.\nWe got there & the place looked dingy, dark & gloomy. With the rain outside, it only made it worse. The food seemed like leftovers from lunch. All the dishes were with curry stains from Lunch. Not Cleaned up. The Rice was just warming up in a rice cooker & it was at the very bottom of the rice cooker, making it obvious that it was leftover. I understand that they can't waste food, but at least, clean up the dishes, so that you respect your customers. The entire place needs cleaning up & the floor needs to be mopped. \nWe looked around & decided to just give it a try, since we were there already. The food was nothing as expected. I was so looking forward to Indian food. Sadly, it was nothing good. Very basic & overall, tasteless.\nWe finished our meal & came up to pay & the lady says, she charged my Mum an 81 year old lady full price of $10 & my Husband & me the Groupon rate. I was like, what's going on? That's not what you said to me on the phone. When I mentioned it, she says she can't do that & also says that she didn't charge me for the drink. Really? I just had a can of Sprite. That's it. She promised us drinks & said they offered anything, tea, coffee, Mango Lassi & all soft drinks & the Groupon rate for all 3 of us.\nExtra $5 is nothing to write about at all. No big deal. Tha would have been our tip anyway, But it's just that you need to keep your word. If the food was exceptional, I wouldn't bother at all. This was basic food. I cook better Indian food at home. And this charge was for an 81 year old lady, who barely eats anything at all. Specially for dinner.\nAll I can say is, they lost a Customer & Many more with us. I am a person who introduces people to restaurants when we find a good one.

However, if you are looking for awesome traditional Indian food at an EXCELLENT price, then this is the place for you!\n\nKohinoor is located right by ASU in Tempe, so all you college students pay attention, because if I was in school over there I'd be eating at this place all semester long.  It's open until 11pm 7 days a week, and includes the restaurant and a bakery.  \n\nWhen you enter Kohinoor, it's a no fuss kind of place so don't be afraid and seat yourself.  You will be entertained by the big screen television showing one of many interesting Indian soap operas or movies.  Don't be surprised if you are surrounded by a few Indian families, or students because they know good Indian food, and to me that says Kohinoor is the best!\n\nYour server will soon be around with a pitcher of water and two menus for you.  One is the traditional menu you see at most places, appetizers, etc.  The other is your ticket to a great meal...a yellow, single sided, laminated menu with their \"specials\".  Unless you are ordering an appetizer, stick with the yellow menu.  It's divided into Vegetarian, Chicken, and Lamb dinners, all with about 8 or 9 options...$3.99, $4.99, and $5.99 respectively!  These are no small dinners either people!  These dinners include the main dish, jasmine rice, naan, a lentil side, a chickpea side, and yogurt!  For $1 more you can add a mango lassi.

Being somewhat familiar with Indian dishes and starving after Christmas shopping, we made some selections - birbali shorba (very zesty) and samosa (VERY SPICY) to start. I explained, \"I'm allergic to wheat, my sister can't have nuts\". We were planning on sticking with curry dishes with rice for me and some naan for my sister. The waiter assured me the sauces were prepared only with spices, no wheat, flour, nothing. Granted I've eaten Indian before with success, so I knew which dishes had been previously safe.  But we were trying a new place, specializing in southern Indian flavors. My sister tried the Alu Ghobi (not on the menu but still offered if you ask) and the Chicken Tikka Masala (which was delicious). I tried the Lamb Saag (again, not on the menu but offered) which was the best buttery spinach version I've ever had, as well as the Chettinad an earthy dish with whole chilies. The rice was a bit of a disappointment as it was a tad over done, and the spices cooked with it weren't my taste. By the time we had finished our meal and packed up our many leftovers, more customers had joined us so we didn't feel so strange and alone. All was well...until a couple hours later. I'm not sure where I went wrong, if there indeed was gluten in one of the sauces, or what not. All my cherished leftovers had to be thrown away. I would have given the restaurant 3 stars with a warning to fellow celiacs, but then I remembered the bathroom at the restaurant. Let's just say I've seen nicer bathrooms as truck stops. So 2 stars is the best I can do for my personal review.", "name": "Sam"}, {"review_id": "r-YBWmPD2WMx1Su8a5L60iew", "user_id": "u-nzt7SwH8gXccEa5l_RXRUQ", "date": "2013-10-05 17:24:25", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Great attentive service with a wonderful buffet selection.

I also had naan bread and we ordered two appetizers. My usual- vegetable samosa and something different this time. I can't remember the name of it but it was a fried patty type hash brown thing that had spinach and potato inside it and it was really good! You'll see it on the menu under appetizers - you can't miss it. Just read the description. \n\nMy only complaint- I asked for mild sauce (I know I'm a wimp) but the sauce was pretty hot actually.

So I took my friend from out of town here for his birthday. Ordering off the menu is not an easy task. First off for the first 20 minutes we were the only customers in the restaurant. The waiter/ bartender/ pretty much everything there kept walking away while we were talking to him. Then when we went to order he second guessed everything. I asked for the Aloo Vindaloo and he said: that is spicy. I said I know I have had it several times. My friend then ordered off of the chinese food menu and the waiter stared at him and said, what? you don't like indian food? The waiter also questioned my fiance's order when explaining her the dish several times when she acknowledged she understood what she was ordering. We ordered the potato cashew rolls only to be disappointed that they had no flavor. They just tasted like unseasoned mashed potatoes.  I then went to the bathroom and when came out the main dishes were on the table. I asked my fiance and my friend to taste mine and asked \"does this taste like there is milk in there? I am vegan so i specifically ordered my food to ensure there was no dairy. When the waiter came back he asked if I liked it, and I said \"Yes. It is good, but-\" And he cut me off and said he changed my order and mixed it with another curry. I asked him if there was dairy in it and he asked me why. I told him I am a vegan and then he proceeded to say it was my fault I did not tell him. Why should I have to tell him when I ordered a curry that did not have dairy in it to begin with? Who changes someones order and doesn't ask? Then not only did he charge me for all of the curry's he brought me (he insisted on not just bringing me the Aloo Vindaloo, which by the way tasted burnt, but another chickpea curry. so I was charged for 2 Aloo Vindaloos and a chickpea curry and whatever curry was mixed in the first one) but I was also charged for 2 different rice dishes because someone brought us plain basmati rice instead of the cumin basmati rice we ordered. My bill ended up being outrageous but I couldn't even discuss it because the waiter would just walk away. A friend came later on and asked for a dirty martini and got something clear in a martini glass. When he asked for some olives they told him they do not have olives.

Love! I haven't had Indian food this good since I moved home from London. I am sure there are other good Indian restaurants in the Cleveland area; I just haven't found them yet. \n\nBoth Tadka and the Chinese restaurant next door have a sleek modern vibe to their decor (as sleek and modern as you can in a strip mall); probably hoping to cater to new audiences. However, when we walked in - on a Friday night - the place was empty save two small tables. The host cast my mom and I a sideways glance and asked \"Are you here for Indian or Chinese? Cos Chinese is next door.\" We assured him we were there for the curry and were shown to our very long, very low booth. \n\nOur waiter ending being the manager, possibly the owner, so I went with my gut and had him select our courses. He asked our likes and dislikes and went about with suggestions. We started with an \"amuse bouche\" for lack of a better term of chana masala. It was tasty and pleasant way to start the meal. We moved on to our appetizers: samosas and tandoori lamb. The samosas were perfect - crisp, flaky exterior; soft, pillowy interior - and huge! It was the tandoori lamb that stole the show for the entire evening. Four tender chops heartily seasoned with tandoori spice. I think they were too spicy for dear mom - I do believe her spice tolerance has decreased with age (I hope she's not reading this...). They were amazing - perfectly cooked with just the right amount of gamey-ness in the lamb. And yes, you do need a little bit of gamey with lamb otherwise you might as well order beef (but I guess you wouldn't in an Indian restaurant, but anyway...).\n\nAfter our starters we split a basket of regular and garlic nan (don't kiss anyone for at least 24 hours after), plain basmati and tikka masala. I know, tika masala is about as authentic as I am, but it's still tasty and a good intro for mom. Everything was amazing and there was plenty to take home for lunch the next day for both of us. Can you believe it all came to under $40? \n\nThe manager/owner also surprised us with a complimentary dessert.

For some reason I had thought there was an Old Navy somewhere along the line of stores there. Turns out I was incorrect, but I happened to pass by Tadka. I figured, since I'm here and I haven't had dinner yet, why not get some chicken tikka masala. \n\nI had only been here once, when I first moved to Cleveland 3 years ago. I don't recall how my experience was that time, only that I didn't leave upset. I sure as hell remember how it was this time...\n\nI walked into the store and stood by the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign. There were a total of 3 other parties, all sitting at the booths along the right side. All the waitress happened to be huddled together by the POS system chatting. The notice me, and the very nice African American waitress walked up to me and asked me if I was dining in or taking it to-go. I told her I was dining in, party of 1. She asked me if I would like a table or the last empty booth, which one just to the right of me by the door. I told her I'd take the booth. (the restaurant was practically empty, I hate sitting at tables compared to booths, and I figured this would be easiest for everyone since all the customers were sitting in this line of tables).\n\nShe processed to clear of all the extra sets of plates, cups, and utensils. I sat down, while she fetched some water and the menu and told she'd give me a few minutes to look it over. Since I came in with a plan, it didn't take me long to scan the menu and decide what I wanted: 1 chicken tikka masala entree and a side of naan. A couple minutes later, the shorter white, plump waitress came up and asked me if I was ready to order. I gave her my order and she said she would put it right in.\n\nThe order was cooked much faster than I expected,  and within 10 minutes, the 3rd waitress came over with my food, a taller white girl, with strong, masculine cheekbones. She placed me order on the table and left.\n      \n       -At this point, everything had been going swell, I had no reasons to complain and i started digging in.\n\nI had started eating my food and 2 bites in, I decided it would be nice to have a knife. It just so happens the 2 latter waitresses: the plump one and the tall one were  standing by my booth. The plump one was helping a customer who had just walked in and the tall one was loitering close behind her. I looked at her and when she made I eye contact, I asked \"Excuse me, may I have a knife please?\" ---This is where everything started going to s**t.\n\nI had appeared to have struck a nerve with her, sense she looked at me blankly for a good 20 second before say \"yeah...\" She goes to the POS table, grabs a knife and very unenthusiastically hands it to me. I don't expect someone who has to work the dinner shift on a Friday to be the happiest person in the world, but she couldn't wait to walk away, and just kind of hastily handed it to me.\n\nNow, If you've read this far, you'd probably agree that nothing that's happened really warrants a complaint or taking the time to write a critical review. It got worse though.\n\nThrough my entire dinner, she visited all the other booths 2-3 times as she ignored to even come near mine. At some point I ran out of water so I placed the cup on the end of the table so that the next passing waitress might fill it up and I was being super patient about it. She was the only on the area because by this time a bunch of other tables had filled up and the other waitresses were busy there. She looked my direction and specifically at my empty cup several times while she poured more water and refused to come my direction and made her best attempt not to make eye contact. I finally got her attention and asked for some water, and this time she didn't even say a word, she just silently got the pitcher, filled up the cup so fast it almost spilled and left. \n\nBy the time I was done eating, I had given up on getting any attention to ask for the check, so I just sat there quietly till big girl realized i was done eating and asked if I needed anything else.", "name": "Muffin"}, {"review_id": "r-waXPZc74gjoUirflRTUxkw", "user_id": "u-THYhJ6bt_1GIzq_HEigPKQ", "date": "2016-08-01 01:25:54", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Pretty disappointed.

Upon walking in, it became clear pretty quickly that the restaurant was understaffed -- not sure if that's because of the holiday, but other reviews suggest it may be typical. It took a long to get the attention of either of the two servers, and eventually we just grabbed our own menus and plunked ourselves at a table the staff agreed upon that hadn't yet been cleaned up. Our server was, if nothing else, friendly though, and also accommodating to my companion's food allergies.\n\nOnce ordered, the food took a long time to arrive. (Perhaps the kitchen was also understaffed.) Our onion bhaji and chicken pakoras were tasty, but the bhaji were fried slightly too long and so had an edge of burnt taste.\n\nThe main course was a two-curry special which arrived with a generous portion of both rice and naan. I have to give them points for value here ($18 for more than enough food for two people), and the curries were tasty enough, if not terribly memorable. The Chicken Chettinad is a cashew-based dish, which seems somewhat unusual for the typical tikka-masala/butter-chicken menu one finds. The other curry we chose was a Baingan Bartha, which was...serviceable. The special also came with a portion of raita, a slightly soggy papadom, and a decent lime pickle.\n\nI've had much worse Indian and spent more money on it, so I would consider coming back and trying to order some of the other less common dishes, like the special mango fish dish that wasn't available that night.\n\nOne last note: there was a pretty egregious band that played 3 (!) sets while were there, covering all the jazz/pop songs you've heard a million times before in a style you soon hope to forget.

We purchased a voucher from Living Social worth 50$ so when we arrived for our 8PM reservation the restaurant had a fair amount of people.\n\nWe ordered the non-vegetarian platter as an appetizer, the curry special which consisted of chicken chettinad and beef kadhai and the mushroom makini. It took 40 minutes for us to receive the appetizer. We both thought the appetizer was average but nothing relatively special. We received our meals at 9PM, one hour after our arrival. The curry dish my friend ordered was warm but not fresh, the mushroom makini was fresh but the flavour was too much like I was eating butter. I ate about 1/4 of the mushroom makini because the butter taste was overwhelming.\n\nThe service was below average, we had ordered water and when we wanted more there was no one to ask. Upon arrival the table clothes were dirty and the next table was not cleaned. I noticed there were only 2 chefs in the kitchen, 2 waiters and a manager on a Friday evening.\n\nWhen we received our bill, usually when we have a voucher worth 50$ and we did not spend our maximum we would not need to pay tip or the taxes. But in this situation the waiter told us we had to and it was not included with the voucher. So I had to pay the taxes when the voucher would have covered the overall amount, this has never occurred to me as I have used vouchers in the past and if I have not used over the amount given it would be counted as tip. SO I gave the waiter 10$ and on top of that the remainder of the voucher which is 8$ equals 18$ tip which is completely ridiculous for the service we received.

The reservation was for 15, but only 9 of us showed up, which I'm thankful for otherwise I'd probably still be waiting for my food.\nWe arrived at 7:15 and were not offered drinks for half an hour. The drinks themselves took another half hour to show up. Once they finally did we placed our order and realized we may be in for a long night.\nThe server was really nice, but the place was severely understaffed for a Saturday night: 2 servers, 2 cooks and a full restaurant. \nTwo hours after I sat down was when I had my first bite of my samosa appetizer, which was delicious. It would be another 45 minutes before our meals would be on the table. Half of our party was finished eating before a couple of friends received their food. No apologies, no offers, no recognition of how ridiculously long everything was taking. Many tables that arrived after us received their meals et al before us.\n\nThe food was fantastic, which is why I'm giving 2 stars and not 1. The music was cringe-worthy, a catatonic elevator-music band that soullessly covered greats like Hallelujah, I Will Survive and What a Wonderful World. Music that would have complemented the environment would have been more appropriate. After that band a group of people started setting up for a PLAY... Our party marveled at the silence and flickering lights as the actors started constructing their set. Eventually we just couldn't stop laughing; from bad music to no music and faulty electricity,  plus a now 3 hour restaurant experience, and we were all colossally late for the second location of this birthday party (which other people were going to be at who were not joining us for dinner). After the birthday girl finished her meal, she threw down some cash and left to hold the fort down at the tiki bar. NOT the way for a birthday girl to feel.\n\nThe bill organizing was a debacle. We tried to organize a split bill system with our server at the beginning, who told us we'd just sort it all out later. As someone who worked in the industry for years, that is a very bad idea. I figured out my total plus tax and tip and gave my cash before other people were even given their bill. \n\nThe restaurant's grand apologetic gesture came in the form of comp-ing about 6 orders of naan bread, a total of $12. For a group of people ordering multiple drinks and bottles of wine, plus a full meal each, that was pretty measly.\n\nI don't blame the server at all, he was a nice fellow who was working really hard (about 40x harder than anyone else there). The owner really needs to re-evaluate scheduling and have at least two more servers on the floor, a bartender, and three more people in the kitchen in order for the restaurant to run smoothly.

You know what? They do a darn good impression of my favourite Indian restaurant (also helps that it's 2 blocks from my house and not a $600, 5-hour plane ride away!)\n\nWe just stopped in for the lunch special to give them a shot. We ordered Butter Chicken and deep fried onions (I forget what their Indian food name is).\n\nThe butter chicken was excellent, the onions were also tasty, battered just enough, and came with a few sauces (one was a spicy lime, the other I couldn't place, but both were good).\n\nThe lunch special was like $7.99. For that you got the bowl of butter chicken and 4 pieces of Naan bread. It was perfectly filling for lunch and I was happily satisfied, although I'll need to try it at dinner to see if the portions are larger, given their regular $12.99 price tag (+ naan is extra $ as well).\n\nThey do have various naan's available (butter, garlic, pashwari (sp?), etc) so that is always good.

Once for a lunchtime buffet, which was spectacular, and most recently for a quiet dinner for two.\n\nI would give this place five stars if it weren't for the quirky service. As is the case with most establishments in Madison I've noticed lately, the service is often mediocre, inconsistent, or just downright bad. Unfortunately, in this instance, Maharaja was no exception.\n\nMy dining partner and I were promptly greeted by a waiter at our table. Being that the menu is quite extensive and wanting plenty of time to pour over it, I indicated my indecision and told our server that we weren't in any rush. He must've taken that to mean to disappear for the next 30 minutes. During that time, my companion and I decided on an appetizer and I had some questions. Feeling like we were stranded on an island, I closed my menu a couple times as a lifeline signal. That didn't work. Frustrated, we finally flagged someone over. I was irritated that I could've spent all those wasted minutes noshing while pondering my meal selection.\n\nAfter a bit of a communication issue over the menu, we each put in our individual dinner orders. My companion relayed the drink choice: chardonnay, plus a Coke for him. Seeming confused, the waiter attempted to clarify. I interjected with a chuckle, \"well, not in the same glass of course,\" referring to the soda and wine. Moments later, the waiter returned with a wine for me and what appeared to be a watery-Coke for him. It was obvious after the first sip: the chardonnay and Coke were indeed combined. Ummmm, did this just happen??!! Again our server remained MIA. Finally he returned with my companion's entree. But not mine. About a third of the way into HIS meal, my dinner finally arrived. Sorry, but that is just not acceptable. There was no apology and no indication of the extended wait time. \n\nOur service throughout the meal was spotty, with intervals of more frequent attention and drink refills. It is important to note that we showed up just as they opened at 5pm so the restaurant was not busy at all until a bit later into our meal. The food was very good, and mine was nice and spicy as I had requested. Perhaps this was just a fluke, but hopefully next time the quality of food will match the level of service.", "name": "Jenny"}, {"review_id": "r-2GyqXoImjIn_JYmcUD32uA", "user_id": "u-YEh-PiExa0E3p71Nn56umQ", "date": "2012-02-04 19:47:12", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I've had better Indian food once or twice but it has always been in bigger cities and has been much more expensive.

One of those said resolutions was to try Indian food.  Wow. Have I been missing out. I am a fan of heat and spice. I find myself trying to find the next hotter sauce/spice. While I am not sure what it was, I think I found it. I found my breaking point in hot sauces. That alone will bring me back somewhere.\n\nHaving gone on a Friday with a group of woman from work, I really had no idea what i was getting myself into for the lunch buffet. But I decided, heck, I'll try it. Worst case scenario I am out $10. Plus, I figured I had the chance to just try small bites of something I have never had before. \n\nEverything was warm/hot and nothing was sitting out for too long. I wish I could tell you everything I ate, but the two things that really stood out for me were the Tikka Masala and the sausage made with lamb (Which should really say a lot coming from someone who is a faux-vegetarian). \n\nThe only thing that brings down my rating is the decor. I felt like I was walking into a 1980's banquet hall. Besides that, the staff was incredibly kind and helpful. Especially when I started to cry from whatever spoonful of hot sauce I foolishly poured down my throat. \n\nWill I be back? You betcha. Will I eat whatever magical sauce I ate that day? Darn right.

Cafe Krishna stands virtually alone in the Phoenix as the only vegetarian restaurant that fails to offer this.\n\nThis wouldn't be an issue if servers were more willing to ensure that products were dairy free. Getting a confirmation that a menu items are dairy-free from the servers feels like pulling teeth, and I making people's lives more difficult makes me feel uncomfortable. I just want to sit down and eat with no worries. \n\nA simple \"V\" next to all the vegan items would make me feel more inclined to eat at Cafe Krishna, it would make me feel more certain about what I was eating, and it would make the lives for the servers easier not having to run back and forth the kitchen every time I (and every other vegan) have a question about dairy in my food.\n\nThat aside, the food at Krishna can be quite good. I've had crispy, spicy gobi manchurian here and I've had mild, crumbly gobi manchurian. The rasam and sambar is always good. And the dosas are usually a pretty safe bet.

These guys are so lazy or do not know how to make chili bajjis (they did not put in the seasoning - tamarind/onions/other relevant sauces - inside the bajjis). No wonder the chili bajjis were so (spicy) hot.\nRegarding Dosas, the less said the better. Not only they served them cold, but they were also tasteless. Never order coconut dosa here!

I was there recently when they ran out of TP in the lady's bathroom (I actually checked before using THANKFULLY!!).

I usually eat dosa and South Indian fare at Woodlands (Ray and Rural). I tried Cafe Krishna for a change. I was disappointed. The service was lousy. The waitstaff was not rude and in fact they were very friendly but the wait was too long. We ordered an appetizer and two dosas. They took a 30 minutes to bring us our appetizer and another 30 minutes (1 hour) before we got our dosa. It was not busy when we ordered. There were only 3 couples in the restaurant at the time and they had 3 waiters. They never checked on us and we had to flag them down to get our bill. One of the waiters is an Eastern European woman who spoke no English and had never waited tables before. She brought our chaat to our table and didn't even bring plates with it.\n\nThe food itself was good but not noteworthy. Their chutneys were not tasty or flavorful. The coconut chutney at Woodlands is a lot better. The dosa had very little sabji (potato) filling and was nearly entirely just one large crepe. The dosa at Woodlands includes much more sabji. I did like the sabji and thought it was better than Woodlands because it was slightly less greasy. The samosa chaat was not good. It had very little samosa (maybe two small pieces of one samosa)  and the rest of it included vegetables. It wasn't bad but neither was it tasty.\n\nThe only positive aspect to the place was it's ambience. Despite its \"cafe\" name, the place is a sit-down restaurant. It's nicer than many full fledged Indian restaurants in the valley. It was clean, spacious with many booths. and decorated well. You are seated, given a menu and a waiter takes your order. It's not like Woodlands in which you order at the register. It has a full menu but it's vegetarian. It's also a South Indian place so I wouldn't recommend ordering saag paneer and North Indian dishes because South Indians don't know how to cook North Indian food. \n\nI will not come back because the service was too slow. Even when we flagged our waiter for our bill, there was another couple who had sat for 15 minutes and had not even had their drink orders taken. Honestly, why would I wait an hour to eat Dosa when I can go up the street and eat at Woodlands and get the same quality dosa in 10 minutes. I'm pretty forgiving of slow service if the restaurant is super busy or if there is only one server but this was different. You could tell the waiters had no previous experience waiting tables and had no sense of urgency. They didn't know how to refill drinks, check up on you, bring your bill to you on time. It seemed like they were related to the owner or were part owners and tried to be servers. If the restaurant improved their speed and service, I would recommend this place.

My sweetheart discovered this place through a local Yelp event and suggested I give it a shot. A regular patron of another traditional, homestyle Indian restaurant down in Georgia, I thought I should try out the buffet-style Indian meal for lunch that is prevalent with many of these food establishments. The decor was simple yet elegant. The place was dead; somebody ran to the back to grab the hostess to have my family seated and so there was this odd moment of waiting. However the water was brought out immediately, and I ordered a sweet lassi drink. It was rather delicious; cold, creamy, and not full of ice.\n\nI had to try everything. Mind you, I went back to the buffet line twice after just to make sure what I grabbed wasn't a bad batch or to verify that the food was indeed that good. Mixed results. All the food being served was uncovered, so the heat retention wasn't there and the Sterno cans could not maintain proper heat distribution. Scary thought of food-borne illness. I dove in anyway; trying to get the pieces closer to the bottom of the pan whilst crossing my fingers.\n\nThe basmati rice was great and I grabbed small portions of each entree to sample and stir up the taste buds. Lets narrow down to what I like and didn't like. Here are my personal downs: the salad was slightly browning and the cucumbers were sliced rather thick than I would have preferred, nor did the raita yoghurt dressing helped much with flavor in a bland salad. The daal makahni (black lentils with herbs and spices) I couldn't care for much, though others may find it to their liking. I can't remember how the aloo saag (spinach and potatoes) tasted, but it's another one of those dishes I can pass on since the mushy texture of spinach didn't jibe with my appetite.\n\nThe naan flatbread was a little more than crispy for me, however the tender baked portions were just fantastic! I fancied the onion pakora (onion fritters), chana masala (garbanzo beans with herbs and spices), navaratan korma (mixed vegetables in a cheesy cream sauce), chicken chilli (saut\u00e9ed chicken with onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes)... not a fan of spicy foods, but this didn't make me break a sweat and was one of my favorite dishes, malai wings - I want the recipe for this, mint chutney(!), and tamarind chutney(!). The chutneys were not overbearing in flavor and I couldn't help but to swipe the tasty wings in them with every bite. Had a small helping of the gulab jamun (milk balls in sugar syrup) which tasted like doughnut holes bathed in diabetes. The kheer was a delightful sweet rice pudding to end the meal with.\n\nCheap eats, great variety of food, local, ambient music, clean interior. The basement bathroom could use a little spiffying and it ran ice cold water. Service was excellent, and as it should be since there were only two other tables by the time we finished our meal. I will have to come back for dinner next time when I'm back in town. Oh, and that gentleman in the back corner staring at my table: please don't; it is rude and downright creepy. Would I come back?

I stuck with what I know: Chicken Vindaloo (Extremely spicy, $11.95), plain Naan bread ($1.95 for a generous portion) and Kheer for dessert, which is Basmati rice cooked in sweetened milk, $3.95).  Let me tell you, the Vindaloo IS spicy.  You will need naan for this.  Wow...the rice was cooked perfectly.  There was plenty of chicken and potatoes in the dish.  Very filling.  The Naan was PERFECT, AMAZING, and absolutely wonderful.  They make their food to order, so you will always have fresh food.  The dessert reminds me of and old fashioned dessert, or grits.  It's quite addicting actually.\n\nI had take out.  The containers are reusable, microwave and dishwasher safe, for those of us who like to recycle.  So, that's a plus.  \n\nMy order took 15 minutes.

You can have it really spicy or just medium spicy.  I choose medium.  Once again, rice cooked perfectly.  The sauce is amazing and the cheese cubes melt in your mouth.

The stairwell to get downstairs was absolutely filthy.  The walls are painted white and there is food or something splattered all over them.

I'm glad a great Indian place opened up in downtown. We went to dinner on a Saturday because a few friends of ours had a Groupon. I think it was $50 for $100 worth of food, which wasn't bad at all. With the groupon, we got 4 appetizers, 4 entrees, 2 naans and 4 desserts. Let me tell you, this was enough food for 8 people. \n\nFirst came the papad, which is a fried appetizer of sorts. It kind of resembles a chip, but with Indian spices and sauces. Next, we ordered a variety of appetizers. I got the vegetable platter, which included a samosa, a veggie pakora, a paneer pakora and sort of a potato patty. For $6, I was expecting something more than just 4 pieces, but it was still very good. Everything was perfectly spiced. \n\nFor entrees, I ordered the Shahi paneer at a medium spice level. It was the perfect amount of heat, and you weren't overwhelmed. It was so delicious, and I was definitely eating it with a spoon. We got two orders of garlic naan, which was THE MOST DELICIOUS THING EVER. Seriously, if you haven't ever tried garlic naan, you're missing out on life.  It was a perfect accompaniment with every entree. The rest of the table got the chana masala, indo-chinese chili paneer, and malai kofta. All were very good. We also got a few drinks as well, such as their chai and mango lassi. Delicious! For dessert, we were given the option of kheer (kind of like a rice pudding) and gulab jamun (sort of like fried donuts soaked in a sugar syrup). They were both good, but by that time, we couldn't eat anymore.\n\nI'm glad we had a groupon, because otherwise, it might have been a tad pricey.

So, you know what I'm talking about. The lone toilet stall is so tiny (and with no coat hooks) that you pretty much have to stand on the toilet to get the door closed. And then you can't see a thing because almost no light gets into the stall. The toilet paper is on a weird stick that falls on the floor and lands in... whatever it is that ends up on mens' room floors next to a toilet. So do yourself a favor, don't use the toilet paper. All of which might be tolerable except the light is on a very short timer, with a sensor that doesn't reach into the stall. So you WILL be left in the dark. And no gesture or flailing above/below the divider will trigger the light. So you've got to try to get yourself out of this micro-stall completely blind. A job for Houdini.\n\nI'm not docking a star, because I avoid all restaurant bathrooms anyway, and I'm really more interested in the incoming food, not the outgoing.

Even though they have expanded to another location in Scarborough, so that there are now two Silver Spoons, the Pickering location has managed to maintain consistent quality, although it can vary on days.\nWell, what restaurant doesn't have that problem? You might be suddenly short-staffed (someone down with the flu), or perhaps one of your deliveries didn't make it on time? \nIt is good food. I prefer the Pakistani cuisine: Nihari, Haleem (not always available) and several of the biryanis. They are now offering Sindhi Biryani on weekends, and I'm so pleased! The only way that I could get that in the past was to make it myself using a packaged spice blend. \nIf you want to get Naan, I recommend the Butter Naan. Although it costs a bit more, the butter enhancements really take the Naan to the next level of browning and savoury tastes. Ok, things sit under the heat lamp, but they do not seem to suffer that much (particularly something like Nihari, which is a stew-type dish that can withstand the warming table. Everything has always tasted fresh when I have ordered it.\nI find that the samosas are fairly standard, but there are other appetizers which are more exciting. For people who like the dark meat of the chicken, Lollypop Chicken is great and consistently good. I also enjoy Shami Kabab. If you like fish, don't skip the Fingerfish, which is consistently tasty.\nWhenever I have been there, which is perhaps once a month or two, for the past five years, the portions have been generous.\nI am certainly a fan, and the Silver Spoon fills an important niche in the local, Pickering community as a convenient place to pick up some Halal take-away of decent quality.", "name": "Katya"}, {"review_id": "r-NLaGpX4hCMraZ9OukN0AnQ", "user_id": "u-Uaqawx2iD0mT5YP_akJrJw", "date": "2014-06-27 00:28:47", "rating": 2.0, "text": "Oh, Silver Spoon. I've tried to love you. I've given you so many chances. \n\nBut this just isn't working out anymore.\n\nTo start: the food isn't exactly terrible. It's just...not very good. I've tried almost every meat dish, the chana masala, samosas, biriyanis, etc. Indian take-out is hardly known for its healthiness, but when you order a veal karahi and get two sad chunks of meat floating in half a container in oil, it's a little disheartening. Add to that the fact that food is often sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long...\n\nOn the upside: the chicken biriyani is good bang for your buck - especially during the week when it's on special. You get a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat. It's ready to go, so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for your order. There was that one time they ran out of chicken biriyani (which is understandable when it's on special) but then offered me a \"regular biriyani\" (read: JUST rice) for the same price. Ummm, say what?\n\nI do love their beef samosas - it's just to bad that they NEVER HAVE ANY. Seriously, I have been here early in the evening, at random times during the week, and they have loads of sad looking veggie samosas, but no beef. I feel like the owners need to do a serious evaluation of what works and doesn't work. If you notice you're always selling out of a certain item (and NOT another), doesn't it make sense to up that portion while downsizing another? Who knows.\n\nMy biggest gripe was the chana masala incident.\nThe last time I went in, I ordered a chana masala (which I'm apathetic about, but my husband likes). The girl at the counter kind of made a face and said, \"Oh...no. You don't want that.\" I was confused. There was a whole tray of it there, brimming with chick-pea goodness. \"It's not...good today.\" \n\nWhat? What does that mean? Is the taste just 'off' or had it spoiled? In either event, why is there a full tray of \"not good\" chana masala here for customers to look at (and possible walk out the door with)? I stared at the tray, and she motioned at it again, \"I was just going to remove it from here anyway.\"\n\nBut, um, you didn't. And I was the only person in the store. From the wide glass window, before I even stepped in, I could see that there was no one else even there. She hadn't even come over until I'd been standing there for a few minutes. \n\nIt really bothers me that I still really don't know what was so wrong with an entire tray of food that it would warrant being thrown out - and why it HADN'T been thrown out immediately if it really couldn't be saved. It was clear from the crispiness on the top (you know, that kind of layer of 'skin' that develops?) that it had been sitting for a while. Ultimately, I'm really quite relieved the staff person told me before I bought it, took it home and got diarrhea or something (this would be a much harsher review if that had happened...) And I guess that says something positive about the customer service (sorta...)\n\nAs more and more Indian food places - both takeout and dine-in - emerge in the region, store owners need to realize that customers are going to eventually become more discerning. I really wanted this place to be a favorite - after all, it's very convenient for me - but, sorry, Silver Spoon, you just don't make the cut.", "name": "Heli"}, {"review_id": "r-ZAmkMWTSbWQRO-uEzYmR8g", "user_id": "u-pj7M1RIWV0caCp7Kj91JxA", "date": "2014-12-17 03:39:34", "rating": 3.0, "text": "They do not have lots of crowd and it taste is different than other locations.

My order is now prepared (I guess calling ahead was useless).  I am handed my order 10 minutes later and there's a package of OPENED uncooked frozen puris (Crispy brand) in the bag. I mean really?  If I wanted to make store bought puris at home, I would just do that.  Besides don't they make their own puris from scratch??!  I ask the lady what that's all about, she tells me that's the unfried puris I asked for.  People intervene, usual confusion unfolds and the package of frozen puris are taken back into the kitchen.  10 more minutes later, same woman reemerges with warm puris in foil.   Not wanted to hang around this place anymore, I  head home to feed the troops.
