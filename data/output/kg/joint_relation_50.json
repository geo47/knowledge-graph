Even though Silver Spoon have expanded to another location in Scarborough  so that there are now two Silver Spoons the Pickering location has managed to maintain consistent quality  although consistent quality can vary on days. Well  what restaurant does not  have that problem You might be suddenly short - staffed  someone down with the flu   or perhaps one of your deliveries did not  make it on time It is good food. Katya prefer the Pakistani cuisine :  Nihari Haleem not always available  and several of the biryanis. Silver Spoon are now offering Sindhi Biryani on weekends  and Katya m so pleased ! The only way that Katya could get Sindhi Biryani in the past was to make Sindhi Biryani Katya using a packaged spice blend. If you want to get Naan  Katya recommend the Butter Naan. Although the Butter Naan costs a bit more the butter enhancements really take Naan to the next level of browning and savoury tastes. Ok  things sit under the heat lamp but things do not seem to suffer that much  particularly something like Nihari  which is a stew - type dish that can withstand the warming table. Everything has always tasted fresh when Katya have ordered it. Katya find that the samosas are fairly standard  but there are other appetizers which are more exciting. For people who like the dark meat of the chicken Lollypop Chicken is great and consistently good. Katya also enjoy Shami Kabab. If you like fish  do not  skip the Fingerfish  which is consistently tasty. Whenever Katya have been there  which is perhaps once a month or two  for the past five years the portions have been generous. Katya am certainly a fan  and Silver Spoon fills an important niche in the local  Pickering community as a convenient place to pick up some Halal take - away of decent quality.", "relationMentions": [{"em1Text": "Silver Spoon", "em2Text": "Sindhi Biryani", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Silver Spoon", "em2Text": "Shami Kebab", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Katya", "em2Text": "Shami Kebab", "label": "ORDER"}, {"em1Text": "Silver Spoon", "em2Text": "Lollypop Chicken", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Great", "em2Text": "Silver Spoon", "label": "MENU_ATTR_FOR"}, {"em1Text": "Lollypop Chicken", "em2Text": "Great", "label": "IS"}]}, {"sentText": "Silver Spoon, Heli, Oh  Silver Spoon. Heli have  tried to love Silver Spoon. Heli have  given Silver Spoon so many chances. But this just is not  working out anymore. To start :  the food is not  exactly terrible. the food just...not very good. Heli have  tried almost every meat dish  the chana masala  samosas  biriyanis  etc. Indian take - out is hardly known for Indian take - out's healthiness but when you order a veal karahi and get two sad chunks of meat floating in half a container in oil it is  a little disheartening. Add to that the fact that food is often sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long... On the upside :  the chicken biriyani is good bang for your buck  -  especially during the week when the chicken biriyani is  on special. You get a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat. a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat  ready to go so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for your order. There was that one time they ran out of chicken biriyani  which is understandable when the chicken biriyani is  on special  but then offered me a  regular biriyani read : JUST rice  for the same price. Ummm  say what   Heli do love their beef samosas -  it is  just to bad that they NEVER HAVE ANY. Seriously  Heli have been here early in the evening  at random times during the week  and they have loads of sad looking veggie samosas  but no beef. Heli feel like the owners need to do a serious evaluation of what works and does not  work. If you notice you are  always selling out of a certain item  and NOT another   does not  it make sense to up a certain item while downsizing another Who knows. My biggest gripe was the chana masala incident. The last time Heli went in  Heli ordered a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about  but my husband likes . The girl at the counter kind of made a face and said Oh... no. Heli do not  want a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes. Heli was confused. There was a whole tray of a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes there  brimming with chick - pea goodness. a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes not... good today. What What does that mean  Is the taste just  off  or had a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes spoiled  In either event why is there a full tray of  not good  chana masala here for customers to look at  and possible walk out the door with   Heli stared at a full tray of  not good  chana masala  and The girl at the counter motioned at a full tray of  not good  chana masala again Heli was just going to remove a full tray of  not good  chana masala from here anyway. But  um  Heli did not . And Heli was the only person in the store. From the wide glass window  before Heli even stepped in  Heli could see that there was no one else even there. She had not  even come over until Heli would  been standing there for a few minutes. It really bothers me that Heli still really do not  know what was so wrong with an entire tray of food that an entire tray of food would warrant being thrown out  -  and why an entire tray of food HADN T been thrown out immediately if an entire tray of food really could not  be saved. It was clear from the crispiness on the top you know that kind of layer of  kin  that develops   that an entire tray of food had been sitting for a while. Ultimately  Heli m really quite relieved the staff person told me before Heli bought a full tray of  not good  chana masala took a full tray of  not good  chana masala home and got diarrhea or something this would be a much harsher review if that had happened... And Heli guess that says something positive about the customer service  sorta... As more and more Indian food places -  both takeout and dine - in  -  emerge in the region  store owners need to realize that customers are going to eventually become more discerning. Heli really wanted this place to be a favorite  -  after all  this place is  very convenient for me  -  but  sorry Silver Spoon Silver Spoon just do not  make the cut.", "relationMentions": [{"em1Text": "Silver Spoon", "em2Text": "Chana Masala", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Heli", "em2Text": "Chana Masala", "label": "ORDER"}, {"em1Text": "Silver Spoon", "em2Text": "Beef", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Heli", "em2Text": "Beef", "label": "ORDER"}, {"em1Text": "Silver Spoon", "em2Text": "Food", "label": "HAS_ASPECT"}, {"em1Text": "Terrible", "em2Text": "Silver Spoon", "label": "ASPECT_ATTR_FOR"}, {"em1Text": "Food", "em2Text": "Terrible", "label": "IS"}]}, {"sentText": "Silver Spoon, Adnan, Silver Spoon do not have lots of crowd and it taste is different than other locations.

Ankita like the Tandoori and Achari chicken -  Silver Spoon's Biriyani is pretty up there in terms of quality. -  Silver Spoon does not  have the best butter chicken. In fact  the best butter chicken is  spicy. When is butter chicken ever spicy  ! Silver Spoon is not  an eat - in restaurant. Silver Spoon a takeout and catering joint. The Mississauga location runs out of food in the evening. Any later than  pm and it is  probably all gone. Silver Spoon have  run out of biriyani by  pm on weekends.

Pierre have to say Pierre have  definitely had better Indian food for some reason the taste does seen rather bland for authentic Indian cuisine Pierre think the chiefs play it safe with the level of spice. Most dishes are delicious it just seems like something is missing for authentic Indian cuisine to be considered real great Indian cuisine. Pierre do not know enough about how to cook Indian food to say exactly what it is. Pierre like the fact that the dishes are not salty  the only time Pierre feel bad from the food is when Pierre eat to much. The tandoori although good seems a little short on flavor  small pieces the butter chicken is quite disappointing the butter chicken is very rich and does not  taste  like butter chicken Pierre remember from other restaurants  not to mention the butter chicken has bones in the butter chicken what a sin. There always seems to be more sauce than chicken. The pieces Pierre thought were quite small. The beef dish is good  the curry goat and chicken not so much the meat on these dishes seems very tough Pierre think Bombay Buffet use the cheapest meat for Bombay Buffet. Pierre have not   tried the dishes on the menu yet bet Pierre assume the dishes on the menu are allot better. The veggie dishes seem old like The veggie dishes have  been sitting The veggie dishes's for days overall Bombay Buffet does not seem to heat the food Pierre have never seen the food really hot there not cold just lukewarm. The only hot item is when Bombay Buffet bring the Nan bread from the oven. Pierre really wish Bombay Buffet had more of those famous  Indian deserts  instead of ice cream which Pierre do not  think is sanitary to leave ice cream there and everybody dig in to ice cream and they need to cover ice cream separately as well not just the door. The service unfortunately is not that great either the owner is very friendly however the waiters seem disengaged like the waiters just want to go home no small talk no smile nothing. The worst thing for m about being served in a restaurant is when Pierre have to ask for EVERYTHING Pierre do not  mind sometimes but Pierre always have to ask for another drink  more water napkins remove bottles etc. every single time. Bombay Buffet does give the appearance of being clean especially the washrooms which is one of the reasons Pierre go back. Pierre must say Pierre have seen attitude from some of the staff again not the owner. On one occasion a girl working there who Pierre never seen  before or ever since actually spoke rather rudely to Pierre in an unfriendly tone for putting a little sauce back on the buffet dish from Pierre's plate OMG Call the police lol. Last thing Pierre want to address is the decor definitely needs an upgrade seating could be set up better to maximize space the carpet looks old and decrepit and the T.V looks nice but Pierre have  never seen the T.V on. Pierre do not  think they want to pay for cable and no clock whats up with that oh Pierre get it do not  let people know what time it is so people wo not  leave to soon or have another beverage. The thing Pierre hate about the buffet section is there is no light Pierre think it should be the other way around lots of light to see Bombay Buffet and less light in the dinning room perhaps candles would make for a better dinning experience  flowers would create ambience sometimes the music is too loud for dinning. Pierre think rather than everybody so close to each other in the dinning room they should use the other room as well especially on the weekends where seating is an issue. One more thing  through the week business is petty slow sometimes only Pierre and a few people are there. So why play games with the few customers you have  one time a waiter who is no longer there charged Pierre imported price for domestic beer Pierre brought domestic beer to the owner  attention and the owner adjusted the bill the next time Pierre went no apologies were given everybody know Budweiser is domestic duh. Another time Pierre specifically asked for a Canada Dry Ginger Ale and a Canada Dry Ginger Ale is  the name a Canada Dry Ginger Ale is listed as on the menu the owner brings a Canada Dry Ginger Ale to Pierre and life is good. The next one Pierre ordered the owner brings no name ginger ale Pierre was so angry Pierre just left as soon as Pierre finished the meal Pierre did not  want to lose it. Ant the no name of course tastes like crap tastes is  why no name ginger ale's cheap but the owner still charged Pierre the   . . One time the said waiter who is no longer there when Pierre asked the said waiter who is no longer there when Pierre asked him to remove the bottles from the table to remove the bottles from the table the owner said Pierre have a big table with lots of room. What the hell is the owner talking to Pierre like that for. Unbelievable this is not how you talk to customers who pay your bills. As you can imagine it was reflected in the tip.

So A coworker of mine got A coworker of mine's wrap and A coworker of mine started eating a chicken wrap. Since its a wrap unless you disassemble a chicken wrap you would not know by the looks of a chicken wrap whether it was red or white meat inside so A coworker of mine took a bite and ate a chicken wrap. Never in A coworker of mine's life A coworker of mine tasted beef so A coworker of mine ask us taste a chicken wrap since a chicken wrap tasted weird for A coworker of mine. So Lia disassembled a chicken wrap at this point and tasted the meat inside a chicken wrap. the meat inside it was beef !  !  !  !  ! At that point Lia's coworker talked to the cashier and informed the cashier that instead of giving A coworker of mine's chicken  A coworker of mine gave A coworker of mine's beef. Instead of apologizing  Lia raised Lia's voice to Lia's coworker and told A coworker of mine A coworker of mine made a mistake on A coworker of mine's order which was not true at all. Unfortunately  Lia do not  have a proof since the receipt just says lunch special. Lia did not apologized   Lia did not even offer to give A coworker of mine a replacement. At this point Lia's coworker even though clearly upset but hungry  ordered another chicken wrap despite us telling A coworker of mine not to do it and Lia can just transfer to another restaurant. Lia was well tempted to just really make a scene but Lia do not  want to stoop down to Lia's level. The   of us and all other people that Lia know of swear never again to go back to Afghan Cuisine ! Lia understand that the reason that the cashier would have not  admitted the cashier's mistake was that it might end up that the cashier foot the bill. But what Lia do not  understand is why Lia needs to raise Lia's voice to Lia's coworker. A simple hint of humility could have been ok.

Malinda have  lived all over India  and have had Indian enough to know ...  good from great . Soma Grill is truly  great  food. Malinda have  been to Soma Grill with my husband over a dozen times and Malinda will  keep coming back. Why  you ask Well  the answer is simple. The food is hand made every day  the staff is full of heart and spirt  and the owner is a wonderful woman who truly cares about the owner's guests. Here  some things Malinda would  like to brag about eating there : Start with the :  Vegetable Samosa   comes with an order of two and two dipping sauces   -  these triangular delights are a perfect way to start your meal. The green dipping sauce is perfectly spicy and compliments the brown sweet dipping sauce. YUM ! ! ! For dinner Malinda share. Here  what Malinda love there ... but first  you must know dinner comes with a cup of mildly spicy and delicious lentil soup  as well as a fresh salad. a fresh salad has a zesty yogurt dressing lightly garnishing the top of a fresh salad. Now for the main course. Chicken Tikka Masala  Chicken Tikka Masala comes in a light red orange cream sauce  Chicken Tikka Masala is tender and a light red orange cream sauce has a bold rich tomato flavor. Mmmmm ... Get the Naan to dip in a light red orange cream sauce so no drop goes to waste. Lamb Kashmiri  Lamb Kashmiri has a mild burgandy sauce with almonds in Lamb Kashmiri Lamb Kashmiri tastes like Lamb Kashmiri has been cooking all day. If you have  ever had  osso bucco  from an Italian restaurant ... you know osso bucco  from an Italian restaurant. Lamb Kashmiri is as tender as osso bucco  from an Italian restaurant. AND a mild burgandy sauce with almonds in it  a mild burgandy sauce with almonds in it has a ton of flavor. If you eat lamb lamb is something you must try. Fish Cod  Madras this dish is perfectly cooked white fish in a very fresh rich colored tomato sauce with onions and mushrooms What Malinda really like about this dish is how much this dish complements the heavier flavors in a light red orange cream sauce. If you are  looking for a vegetable dish my husband and Malinda have tried a few of a vegetable dish. my husband and Malinda's favorite is the  Aloo Gobi    Aloo Gobi the  Aloo Gobi has potato  and cauliflower mixed in a light  fresh crushed tomato sauce the  Aloo Gobi  very good and a nice compliment to all the meat dishes Malinda order  to share. Malinda have  had both the garlic and regular naan. both the garlic and regular naan are  perfect for dipping  and in my opinion naan is a  must have  when eating an Indian meal. Rice comes with the meals so if you do not  want bread but want a starch you will  be happy to know white rice accompanies all entrees. As for dessert Malinda have  had the rice pudding and pistachio ice - cream this is the kulfi  on the menu. Between those two  Malinda would  pick the pistachio ice - cream every time. the pistachio ice - cream very refreshing after a hot meal. Also  each time Malinda visit Malinda always get the hot chai tea. the hot chai tea is made to order and is worth the wait. You add the sugar which puts you in the drivers seat  as far as sweetness goes. Malinda recommend Soma Grill to anyone looking to try something other than a chain restaurant. Soma Grill is worth a try and if you already like Indian food take Malinda's dinner suggestions. You wo not  be sorry !

Sujith have tried both dinner and buffet at Hyderabad House Arizona both dinner and buffet were top notch. Let me start with dinner  Sujith ordered chef special Gobi for appetizer and veg dum biriyani. chef special Gobi for appetizer was delicious and best Sujith had till date in AZ. veg dum biriyani was equally tasty. Sujith went for the weekend buffet and there were tons of items. Sujith was pretty pleased Hyderabad House Arizona had many more veg items compared to   non - veg dishes. Sujith the never seen a veg biriyani being part of buffet. a veg biriyani was always chicken biriyani. So Sujith's non - veg friends were not too pleased with this. my non - veg friends had a paneer pulao so Sujith would suggest to replace a paneer pulao with a non - veg rice item. For Sujith the highlight was Aloo Bonda and the fried baby corn. Sujith cannot finish this review without mentioning the awesome Sambar. the awesome Sambar is hands down the best in the valley. Sujith had Sambar with uttapam and also with rice. The last time Sujith had Sambar with rice was at bheemas in CA so this was worth it. the weekend buffet runs at   . which is a little bit on the expensive side.

In addition  Hello noticed the lack of papadum and the various chutneys Hello was familiar with receiving at every Indian restaurant Hello had ever been too. However  Hello forgave this as maybe things are not the same in Las Vegas as Los Angeles. On the topic of service  every single item Hello ordered took absurdly long to prepare  considering Hello were the ONLY customers present. In fact  one of my uncles had specially ordered a Chana masala without onion and garlic because one of my uncles does not  eat onion and garlic. a Chana masala without onion and garlic did not  even show up until the rest of us had almost finished eating. Service aside  let  move on to the most important part :  quality of food. The vegetable Pakora  the first appetizer  was literally a cauliflower fried in unseasoned batter which was disgusting. Hell  anyone could make better pakoras than what was prepared by Armaan Taste of India. On some pieces  Hello could see the raw cauliflower which had none of unseasoned batter. Unappetizing much  Hello decided to clear my mind; perhaps the main dishes would be somewhat decent. Oh boy  was Hello wrong ! The paneer tikka masala tasted like someone had dumped heaps of tomato paste  tomato pur e  and chunks of tomato  with sugar and small sprinkles of Indian spices. This was despite my request for extremely spicy paneer tikka masala. The malai kofta gravy tasted like raw sewage diluted with turmeric and chilly power. By far  the most disgusting dish. The channa masala which my uncle had ordered looked like little shit pieces in brown gravy. The next morning  my uncle said one of my uncles threw up all of the disgusting channa masala. Hello presume the high ratings are from non - Indians who do not  know how delicious Indian food can be when prepared properly. To you  Hello suggest visiting restaurants recommended by any Indians you may know. Once you visit a proper Indian restaurant you will agree with my review and agree with how an abomination of a restaurant Armaan Taste of India is.", "relationMentions": [{"em1Text": "Armaan Taste of India", "em2Text": "Cauliflower", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Hello", "em2Text": "Cauliflower", "label": "ORDER"}]}, {"sentText": "Armaan Taste of India, Norm, Norm came here for dinner last night and was handed the all you can eat dinner menu.

Norm ordered : Papadi chaat Onion pakora Chili chicken Tadaka daal Matar mushroom Baigan bharta Badami kheer Gulab jamun The standout dishes were Papadi chaat  and Tadaka daal. Papadi chaat was made with chick peas  pieces of finely chopped potato  tomatoes  and flour crisps. When Norm have  had chaat before  chaat generally had rice crisps. rice crisps were flour and were just as good. Papadi chaat had a very nice spice tang to Papadi chaat as did almost all the dishes Norm tried. Baigan bharta is roasted eggplant cooked with spices in peanut seasoned coconut sauce. The two desserts -  - kheer and Gulab jamun -  -  were standard for Indian restaurants. Norm like the fact that the servings are small dishes so you can try different things. Norm wish there was more of a selection but Norm understand they have to limit more of a selection because of cooking time. Norm was the only one in Armaan Taste of India when Norm arrived a little after  . Later  two other parties came in but it was a slow night while Norm was there.

Ayesha get really good nihari near home so Ayesha did not  try really good nihari  but from the looks of what Ayesha saw on other people  table really good nihari seemed pretty good.

Even though Silver Spoon have expanded to another location in Scarborough  so that there are now two Silver Spoons the Pickering location has managed to maintain consistent quality  although consistent quality can vary on days. Well  what restaurant does not  have that problem You might be suddenly short - staffed  someone down with the flu   or perhaps one of your deliveries did not  make it on time It is good food. Katya prefer the Pakistani cuisine :  Nihari Haleem not always available  and several of the biryanis. Silver Spoon are now offering Sindhi Biryani on weekends  and Katya m so pleased ! The only way that Katya could get Sindhi Biryani in the past was to make Sindhi Biryani Katya using a packaged spice blend. If you want to get Naan  Katya recommend the Butter Naan. Although the Butter Naan costs a bit more the butter enhancements really take Naan to the next level of browning and savoury tastes. Ok  things sit under the heat lamp but things do not seem to suffer that much  particularly something like Nihari  which is a stew - type dish that can withstand the warming table. Everything has always tasted fresh when Katya have ordered it. Katya find that the samosas are fairly standard  but there are other appetizers which are more exciting. For people who like the dark meat of the chicken Lollypop Chicken is great and consistently good. Katya also enjoy Shami Kabab. If you like fish  do not  skip the Fingerfish  which is consistently tasty. Whenever Katya have been there  which is perhaps once a month or two  for the past five years the portions have been generous.

Heli have  tried to love Silver Spoon. Heli have  given Silver Spoon so many chances. But this just is not  working out anymore. To start :  the food is not  exactly terrible. the food just...not very good. Heli have  tried almost every meat dish  the chana masala  samosas  biriyanis  etc. Indian take - out is hardly known for Indian take - out's healthiness but when you order a veal karahi and get two sad chunks of meat floating in half a container in oil it is  a little disheartening. Add to that the fact that food is often sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long... On the upside :  the chicken biriyani is good bang for your buck  -  especially during the week when the chicken biriyani is  on special. You get a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat. a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat  ready to go so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for your order. There was that one time they ran out of chicken biriyani  which is understandable when the chicken biriyani is  on special  but then offered me a  regular biriyani read : JUST rice  for the same price. Ummm  say what   Heli do love their beef samosas -  it is  just to bad that they NEVER HAVE ANY. Seriously  Heli have been here early in the evening  at random times during the week  and they have loads of sad looking veggie samosas  but no beef. Heli feel like the owners need to do a serious evaluation of what works and does not  work. If you notice you are  always selling out of a certain item  and NOT another   does not  it make sense to up a certain item while downsizing another Who knows. My biggest gripe was the chana masala incident. The last time Heli went in  Heli ordered a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about  but my husband likes . The girl at the counter kind of made a face and said Oh... no. Heli do not  want a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes. Heli was confused. There was a whole tray of a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes there  brimming with chick - pea goodness. a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes not... good today. What What does that mean  Is the taste just  off  or had a chana masala  which Heli m apathetic about but my husband likes spoiled  In either event why is there a full tray of  not good  chana masala here for customers to look at  and possible walk out the door with   Heli stared at a full tray of  not good  chana masala  and The girl at the counter motioned at a full tray of  not good  chana masala again Heli was just going to remove a full tray of  not good  chana masala from here anyway. But  um  Heli did not . And Heli was the only person in the store. From the wide glass window  before Heli even stepped in  Heli could see that there was no one else even there. She had not  even come over until Heli would  been standing there for a few minutes. It really bothers me that Heli still really do not  know what was so wrong with an entire tray of food that an entire tray of food would warrant being thrown out  -  and why an entire tray of food HADN T been thrown out immediately if an entire tray of food really could not  be saved. It was clear from the crispiness on the top you know that kind of layer of  kin  that develops   that an entire tray of food had been sitting for a while. Ultimately  Heli m really quite relieved the staff person told me before Heli bought a full tray of  not good  chana masala took a full tray of  not good  chana masala home and got diarrhea or something this would be a much harsher review if that had happened... And Heli guess that says something positive about the customer service  sorta... As more and more Indian food places -  both takeout and dine - in  -  emerge in the region  store owners need to realize that customers are going to eventually become more discerning. Heli really wanted this place to be a favorite  -  after all  this place is  very convenient for me  -  but  sorry Silver Spoon Silver Spoon just do not  make the cut.", "relationMentions": [{"em1Text": "Silver Spoon", "em2Text": "Chana Masala", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Heli", "em2Text": "Chana Masala", "label": "ORDER"}, {"em1Text": "Silver Spoon", "em2Text": "Beef", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Heli", "em2Text": "Beef", "label": "ORDER"}, {"em1Text": "Silver Spoon", "em2Text": "Food", "label": "HAS_ASPECT"}, {"em1Text": "Terrible", "em2Text": "Silver Spoon", "label": "ASPECT_ATTR_FOR"}, {"em1Text": "Food", "em2Text": "Terrible", "label": "IS"}]}, {"sentText": "Silver Spoon, Adnan, Silver Spoon do not have lots of crowd and it taste is different than other locations.

The chicken Manchurian had tons of cornflour.... both for coating The chicken Manchurian and for thickening the gravy.

Manchurian chicken noodles were average at best had a strong flavour of some stock powder or flavouring. So Manchurian chicken noodles was not  to Rav's liking.

All guests that got seated after Rav got All guests that got seated after us's orders before Rav. Then the food arrived .... in reverse order....lol. First came Manchurian chicken noodles then came the two chicken dishes  and finally came the appetizer. Rav were told that fish pakora  chicken takes a long time to be prepared. While one of the owners was upfront and apologized for the delay  appreciate the delay the other owner said Rav had ordered after all the other guests....which was just made up. But the delay was not  really a big deal. Sometime some dishes may take longer for any number of reasons it is  very understandable. Rav's experience of the dinner here was not  really affected by the wait for the food.... but by the food. Food arrived  backwards  but looked good. Both the deep fried dishes :  fish pakora  chicken and Bombay chicken had a bitter after - taste with every single bite. Both the deep fried dishes :  fish pakora and Bombay chicken tasted of stale overused oil. Clearly the fryer oil was being reused way too much and not being cleaned. This is quite unacceptable as it should be very obvious for any cook to notice that the fryer oil is not fit for cooking anymore. The chicken Manchurian had tons of cornflour.... both for coating The chicken Manchurian and for thickening the gravy. The chicken Manchurian was still edible while piping hot  but as The chicken Manchurian started cooling down... The chicken Manchurian just became more and more disgusting. Manchurian chicken noodles were average at best had a strong flavour of some stock powder or flavouring. So Manchurian chicken noodles was not  to Rav's liking. But Rav guess that is  Hakka Bro's's recipe. Rav do think that Hakka Bro's has the potential to be good. But at this point  a lot of effort is needed on Hakka Bro's's part. Hakka Bro's is quite popular  and seemed busy enough.... which means Hakka Bro's must be appealing to the taste of some guests.

The beautiful rice was plentiful and the nice chef also gave us free tastes of anything Melissa wanted to try. The nan was the only letdown. The nan seemed prepackaged  as in not freshly made. But the rest of the food and yogurt sauce was delicious. Melissa got Melissa's food plus a bottle of water for    bucks. Ca not  wait to get back here !

Now growing up in a family of Indian chefs and doing Ryan's own Indian cooking there was only one restaurant that Ryan like to visit and only one restaurant that Ryan like to visit was the Rajbhoj in the university area. When  Ryan first went to check out Nirvana Ryan was pleasantly surprised to see that the owner was also a chef at Lolas making the Lolas beef tips. If anyone has ever tasted the Lolas beef tips the lolas beef tips is also close as you get to original Portuguese cuisine. Now about Nirvana  ; -  it is more about carrying out than dining in. Once you set that expectation you would be fine. Another thing to keep in mind is that not all Indian food is spicy. Anything that involves cream will be bland for the most part. What the reader Avi A said about the food being bland; -  any lentils or korma will always have some blandness associated for any lentils or korma. If you want something with a flavor and a kick here are some options; -   Chilli chicken Pepper Chicken Any south Indian chicken Curry fish  - Yes this is really good For you non vegetarians ; -   Chama masalla Any peas and mushroom combinations Any kadai combinations The coconut chicken is also good but dont expect The coconut chicken to be spicy. The staff is very friendly and The staff do take feedback. So if you have to say something tell The staff. It will only help improve The staff's cusine.

Jacob wasted most Jacob's lunch break roaming around uptown  now on foot looking for the restaurant. the restaurant is neatly tucked away in some building on MLK blvd  not really S Tryon which is probably what caused all Jacob's confusion. But alas Jacob made the restaurant ! For Jacob's first trip Jacob ordered Chicken Tikka Masala with a side of curried potatoes and eggplant. Chicken Tikka Masala was awesome Chicken Tikka Masala was very mild which was nice since the potatoes and egg plant was quite spicy. Jacob went again today ordering Chicken Tikka Masala again  the chili chicken or pepper chicken looked great but Jacob's stomach has been sensitive to spicy lately  hope that passes. The sides were Aloo Bhindi  potato okra Navratan Korma and Jacob got a mango lassi. This all came out to ten dollars Jacob swear it was pushing five pounds of food. Jacob should have weighed it once Jacob got back to the office. Chicken Tikka Masala once again was great  Navratan Korma was mildly spiced and the pineapple really made Navratan Korma stand out. But Aloo Bhindi is what Jacob was excited about the most. Jacob had no idea Okra was a big deal out of the south east  probably because Jacob's mid western GF had never heard of Okra. Aloo Bhindi was very good  almost tasted like the same spices from the eggplant potato curry but not as spicy. For someone who has recently discovered a love for Indian food and by recently Jacob mean six months  Jacob enjoyed Nirvana II.

Gone were the friendly owners  replaced by a new crop of much younger  less interested employees.

Brendon have  walked in at    :    am and they are  still setting up Prices went up  small changes to the menu items started showing up and the coma - inducing  extra scoops of food that really defined the value of their offering started to wane. In other words  now you are  getting too much food  instead of WAYYY too much food  for     instead of   . Subtle - but impactful to the discerning lunch goer. One correctable  subtle issue that popped up  and still persists today as Brendon pull another one out of Brendon's mouth while chewing and writing this review  is exhibited by the fact that Nirvana II cook with in - tact  full - sized Cardamom pods and cloves. Now in and of itself  this is not at all an issue  and in fact encouraged as the subtle flavors are a terrific layer of flavor. The problem exists when in - tact  full - sized Cardamom pods and cloves are not removed prior to serving the dish and so you will  occassinally get a mouthfull of surprise when you bite into an entire Cardamom pod which can simply destroy your pallette for the next several minutes. It  a rookie mistake  that can be easily changed and make a subtle improvement to their quality.

The subtle changes that the Aroma management team has made have deteriorated the overall offering beyond Brendon's comfort zone.

The other factor here is that Persis Biriyani opened up a place across the street in the Latta Arcade.

OM Restaurant's located on a plaza by     and Eastern. a plaza by and Eastern is always busy with many restaurants in OM Restaurant so parking might be a small issue. OM Restaurant is not lavish like many other Indian restaurants  OM Restaurant have TV where some Indian music is played but over all OM Restaurant's atmosphere is more like  Roberto . The owners are Nepalese  and the food is mainly north Indian with some that have obvious Nepalese fusion to the food. Kart always get two curries  naan and basmati rice at OM Restaurant. So far Kart have tried Chicken Tikka Masala  Palak Panner  Spinach w  cottage cheese  Kart's fav. Chilli Chicken  Chicken Karai  and OM Restaurant's Garlic Naan. Kart think OM Restaurant has the most authentic Indian flavor of any restaurant and the food is cooked fresh in front of you. the prices are also very low compared to Taj and Mint. and OM Restaurant's an excellent place for take out meals.

Julia ordered vegetable samosas  vegetable pakoras butter chicken  lamb biryani and three plain naan.

Julia got home and ripped into our meal  and Julia was very impressed. This ai not no pre made frozen samosas  pakoras or naan. You can tell three plain naan was made with tender love and care  nice and pillowy  Julia wanted to take a nap on three plain naan. three plain naan also wasn;t covered in burned bits  like some naan  which Julia assume comes from a dirty tandoori oven. The samosas and pakoras were exceptional and very tasty. butter chicken was also excellent  Julia am not a fan of the giant chicken chunks  and butter chicken was nicely cut in bite size portions and the sauce was tangy and flavourful.

The spiciest dish on the buffet were the pakora   which was a surprise as the buffet also had the chick peas  which are usually a bit spicy  but here were rather bland . Unfortunately for Jim  the best part of the buffet was the naan bread...which is a staple at every Indian restaurant. Jim recall a few years back coming across a drink Jim used to love as a kid and buying a drink Jim used to love as a kid and being hugely disappointed at how the memory of a drink Jim used to love as a kid was actually better than a drink Jim used to love as a kid....... Jim felt that same feeling after eating here.", "relationMentions": [{"em1Text": "Bombay Palace", "em2Text": "Tandori Chicken", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Flavourful", "em2Text": "Bombay Palace", "label": "MENU_ATTR_FOR"}, {"em1Text": "Tandori Chicken", "em2Text": "Flavourful", "label": "IS"}]}, {"sentText": "Bombay Palace, Jessica, My husband and Jessica visited Bombay Palace twice on a recent trip to Toronto. As newcomers to Toronto  Jessica stumbled upon Bombay Palace quite by accident the first time  but loved Bombay Palace enough to come back the next day. Bombay Palace had a reasonably priced lunch buffet with hot choices like chana masala  tandoori chicken butter chicken  beef curry  and eggplant masala. A separate cold bar had all the fixings  like a simple salad  mango chutney raita  rice pudding. There was even a small case of chocolate  vanilla  mango  and strawberry ice cream sherbet. The best part  -  everything was great ! The naan went fast and was gone by the time Jessica went to the buffet so the waiter host brought My husband and Jessica a fresh serving from the kitchen. Out of this world ! the waiter host told My husband and Jessica The naan would be the best naan Jessica would  ever have  and the waiter host was right. Speaking of the service the waiter host  Jessica believe the waiter host's name is Rajiv  was incredibly friendly and helpful. You could tell that the waiter host loves the waiter host's restaurant and the waiter host's job. the waiter host made My husband and Jessica feel welcome and answered all My husband and Jessica's questions about the food and restaurant  and the silly Canadian HST tax . The next night  Jessica ended up at Bombay Palace again  -  this time for dinner. Instead of a buffet  Jessica ordered from the menu and were completely blown away. The chicken tikka masala was savory with the perfect balance of onions  tomatoes  and green peppers. Jessica's chicken korma was the best Jessica have  ever had. Not too sweet not too creamy  and a wonderful hint of coconut and ginger. My chicken korma was moist and plentiful. Just thinking about My chicken korma makes Jessica want to go back to Toronto. At lunch the day before  the waiter host urged My husband and Jessica to try the garlic naan. Jessica were so full that Jessica did not   so Jessica ordered the garlic naan at dinner. Words cannot describe the deliciousness of that bread. Most places use too much garlic and overpower The naan; not Bombay Palace. The naan was slightly crispy on the outside  nice and fluffy on the inside  and the garlic just hit The naan out of the park. Ever heard of the show The Best Thing Jessica Ever Ate   -  Bombay Palace  garlic naan and My chicken korma would be  one of  Jessica's pick s  for that show.

Din called the owner earlier in the evening  as Din wanted to purchase a Groupon for the Buffet. a Groupon was for      or   people. Din were    my Husband me's husband my Husband   me my Husband me's Mum. So Din asked the owner about it as Din wanted to know if this place offered a Senior citizens discount  so that Din could buy a Groupon for the both of us   pay for my Husband me's Mum. the owner then told me  that Din need not buy the Groupon   that Din could come in   the owner would give Din the Groupon price for all three  with drinks included. the Groupon price for all three  with drinks included would have been    per person for the Buffet. So Din was happy with that. Din got there this place looked dingy dark   gloomy. With the rain outside  it only made it worse. The food seemed like leftovers from lunch. All the dishes were with curry stains from lunch. Not Cleaned up. The Rice was just warming up in a rice cooker The Rice was at the very bottom of a rice cooker  making it obvious that The Rice was leftover. Din understand that this place can not  waste food  but at least  clean up the dishes  so that this place respect this place's customers. this place needs cleaning up   the floor needs to be mopped. Din looked around decided to just give this place a try  since Din were there already. The food was nothing as expected. Din was so looking forward to Indian food. Sadly  The food was nothing good. Very basic overall  tasteless. Din finished our meal   came up to pay the owner says  the owner charged Din's Mum an    year old lady full price of       Din's Husband   me the Groupon rate. Din was like  what is  going on That  not what the owner said to me on the phone. When Din mentioned it the owner says the owner can not  do that   also says that the owner did not  charge Din for the drink. Really  Din just had a can of Sprite. That  it. the owner promised us drinks   said this place offered anything  tea coffee Mango Lassi all soft drinks   the Groupon rate for all   of us. Extra    is nothing to write about at all. No big deal. Tha would have been our tip anyway But it is  just that you need to keep your word. If the food was exceptional  Din would not  bother at all. the food was basic food. Din cook better Indian food at home. And this charge was for an    year old lady  who barely eats anything at all. Specially for dinner. All Din can say is  this place lost a Customer Many more with us. Din am a person who introduces people to restaurants when Din find a good one.

After walking in on the Indian side of Tadka Restaurant with Sam's sister and seeing literally no one in the seating area at   : pm on a Sunday  Sam were a little nervous. Sam tracked down a waiter at the bar on the Bamboo Garden side    restaurant  -    sides    entrances  but the Bamboo Garden side    restaurant  -    sides    entrances connect in the middle . Sam were seated in a booth only slightly above ground level and given menus. Being somewhat familiar with Indian dishes and starving after Christmas shopping  Sam made some selections -  birbali shorba very zesty  and samosa VERY SPICY  to start. Sam explained   Sam m allergic to wheat  Sam's sister can not  have nuts . Sam were planning on sticking with curry dishes with rice for Sam and some naan for Sam's sister. a waiter assured Sam the sauces were prepared only with spices  no wheat flour  nothing. Granted Sam have  eaten Indian before with success so Sam knew which dishes had been previously safe. But Sam were trying Tadka Restaurant. Sam's sister tried the Alu Ghobi  not on the menu but still offered if you ask  and the Chicken Tikka Masala  which was delicious . Sam tried the Lamb Saag  again  not on the menu but offered  which was the best buttery spinach version Sam have  ever had  as well as the Chettinad an earthy dish with whole chilies. The rice was a bit of a disappointment as The rice was a tad over done  and the spices cooked with The rice were not  Sam's taste. By the time Sam had finished our meal and packed up our many leftovers more customers had joined us so Sam did not  feel so strange and alone. All was well...until a couple hours later. Sam m not sure where Sam went wrong  if there indeed was gluten in one of the sauces  or what not. All Sam's cherished leftovers had to be thrown away. Sam would have given the restaurant   stars with a warning to fellow celiacs but then Sam remembered the bathroom at Tadka Restaurant. Let  just say Sam have  seen nicer bathrooms as truck stops.

Jacqueline said The waiter  bartender know The waiter  bartender have had the Aloo Vindaloo several times. Jacqueline's friend then ordered off of the chinese food menu and The waiter  bartender stared at my friend and said  what  my friend do not  like indian food The waiter  bartender also questioned Jacqueline's fiance  order when explaining my fiance the dish several times when my fiance acknowledged my fiance understood what my fiance was ordering. Jacqueline ordered the potato cashew rolls only to be disappointed that the potato cashew rolls had no flavor. the potato cashew rolls just tasted like unseasoned mashed potatoes. Jacqueline then went to the bathroom and when came out the main dishes were on the table. Jacqueline asked Jacqueline's fiance and Jacqueline's friend to taste Jacqueline and asked  does this taste like there is milk in there Jacqueline am vegan so Jacqueline specifically ordered Jacqueline's food to ensure there was no dairy. When The waiter  bartender came back The waiter  bartender asked if Jacqueline liked my food  and Jacqueline said  Yes. my food is good  but - And The waiter  bartender cut Jacqueline off and said The waiter  bartender changed Jacqueline's order and mixed my food with another curry. Jacqueline asked The waiter  bartender if there was dairy in my order and The waiter  bartender asked Jacqueline why. Jacqueline told The waiter bartender Jacqueline am a vegan and then The waiter  bartender proceeded to say it was The waiter  bartender's fault Jacqueline did not tell The waiter  bartender. Why should Jacqueline have to tell The waiter  bartender when Jacqueline ordered a curry that did not have dairy in a curry that did not have dairy in it to begin with Who changes someones order and does not  ask  Then not only did The waiter  bartender charge Jacqueline for all of the curry The waiter  bartender brought Jacqueline The waiter  bartender insisted on not just bringing Jacqueline the Aloo Vindaloo  which by the way tasted burnt  but another chickpea curry. so Jacqueline was charged for   Aloo Vindaloos and a chickpea curry and whatever curry was mixed in the first one but Jacqueline was also charged for   different rice dishes because someone brought us plain basmati rice instead of the cumin basmati rice Jacqueline ordered. Jacqueline's bill ended up being outrageous but Jacqueline could not  even discuss My bill because The waiter  bartender would just walk away.

Upon walking in  it became clear pretty quickly that Waterfalls Indian Tapas Bar & Grill was understaffed  -  -  not sure if that is  because of the holiday  but other reviews suggest it may be typical. It took a long to get the attention of either of the two servers  and eventually Luke just grabbed our own menus and plunked ourselves at a table the two servers agreed upon that had not  yet been cleaned up. Our server was  if nothing else  friendly though  and also accommodating to Luke's companion  food allergies. Once ordered  the food took a long time to arrive. Perhaps the kitchen was also understaffed. Our onion bhaji and chicken pakoras were tasty  but onion bhaji were fried slightly too long and so had an edge of burnt taste. The main course was a two - curry special which arrived with a generous portion of both rice and naan. Luke have to give them points for value here      for more than enough food for two people   and the curries were tasty enough  if not terribly memorable. The Chicken Chettinad is a cashew - based dish  which seems somewhat unusual for the typical tikka - masala butter - chicken menu one finds. The other curry Luke chose was a Baingan Bartha  which was...serviceable. a two - curry special which arrived with a generous portion of both rice and naan also came with a portion of raita  a slightly soggy papadom  and a decent lime pickle. Luke have  had much worse Indian and spent more money on it so Luke would consider coming back and trying to order some of the other less common dishes  like the special mango fish dish that was not  available that night.

Cindy ordered the non - vegetarian platter as an appetizer  the curry special which consisted of chicken chettinad and beef kadhai and the mushroom makini. It took    minutes for us to receive the curry special which consisted of chicken chettinad and beef kadhai. Cindy both thought the curry special which consisted of chicken chettinad and beef kadhai was average but nothing relatively special. Cindy received our meals at  PM  one hour after our arrival. The curry dish Cindy's friend ordered was warm but not fresh the mushroom makini was fresh but the flavour was too much like Cindy was eating butter. Cindy ate about     of the mushroom makini because the butter taste was overwhelming. The service was below average  Cindy had ordered water and when Cindy wanted more there was no one to ask. Upon arrival the table clothes were dirty and the next table was not cleaned. Cindy noticed there were only   chefs in the kitchen    waiters and a manager on a Friday evening. When Cindy received our bill  usually when Cindy have a voucher worth and Cindy did not spend our maximum Cindy would not need to pay tip or the taxes. But in this situation the waiter told us Cindy had to and it was not included with a voucher. So Cindy had to pay the taxes when a voucher would have covered the overall amount  this has never occurred to Cindy as Cindy have used vouchers in the past and if Cindy have not used over the amount given the amount given would be counted as tip.

The server was really nice  but Waterfalls Indian Tapas Bar & Grill was severely understaffed for a Saturday night :    servers    cooks and Waterfalls Indian Tapas Bar & Grill. Two hours after Tanya sat down was when Tanya had Tanya's first bite of Tanya's samosa appetizer  which was delicious. It would be another    minutes before our meals would be on the table. Half of our party was finished eating before a couple of friends received a couple of friends's food. No apologies no offers no recognition of how ridiculously long everything was taking. Many tables that arrived after us received Many tables that arrived after us's meals et al before us. The food was fantastic  which is why Tanya m giving   stars and not  . The music was cringe - worthy  a catatonic elevator - music band that soullessly covered greats like Hallelujah  Tanya Will Survive and What a Wonderful World. Music that would have complemented the environment would have been more appropriate.

Eventually Tanya just could not  stop laughing; from bad music to no music and faulty electricity   plus a now   hour restaurant experience  and Tanya were all colossally late for the second location of our party  which other people were going to be at who were not joining us for dinner . After the birthday girl finished the birthday girl's meal  the birthday girl threw down some cash and left to hold the fort down at the tiki bar. NOT the way for a birthday girl to feel. The bill organizing was a debacle. Tanya tried to organize a split bill system with our server at the beginning  who told us Tanya would  just sort it all out later. As someone who worked in the industry for years  a split bill system is a very bad idea. Tanya figured out Tanya's total plus tax and tip and gave Tanya's cash before other people were even given other people's bill. The restaurant  grand apologetic gesture came in the form of comp - ing about   orders of naan bread  a total of    . For a group of people ordering multiple drinks and bottles of wine  plus a full meal each  that was pretty measly.

Our comforter does not  fit in our washing machine   -  -   . Anyway Porruthai like to take a walk and have a dinner while Porruthai are  waiting for our laundry as Porruthai always do once a month. Is not  it an interesting activity for a couple   : Ok. Come back to Delhi Bistro  Porruthai ordered  BUTTER CHICKEN     . and MADRAS CURRY with FISH fillets     . They did not  come with any bread or rice so Porruthai also ordered Garlic NAAN    . and Rice PULAO    .   . The food was terrific ! Porruthai loved The food so much. BUTTER CHICKEN was creamy and sour. MADRAS CURRY with FISH fillets was filled up with a ton of fish fillets. The waiter recommended MADRAS CURRY with FISH fillets if Porruthai wanted to have fish. The waiter said Madras normally was spicy and went well with fish. Porruthai listened to The waiter  : and Porruthai like MADRAS CURRY with FISH fillets. Anyway for Porruthai's taste MADRAS CURRY with FISH fillets was not  that spicy. The waiter noticed and offered to bring Porruthai chopped fresh chilli on the side. Thank The waiter for caring. Delhi Bistro was a small to medium size. Delhi Bistro have an opened kitchen that you can see what Delhi Bistro are  doing inside. There were not many customers when Porruthai were there but Porruthai believe that Delhi Bistro have regular customers here. At first Porruthai felt the price was a bit pricey but after those things went into Porruthai's stomach Porruthai could not  say that anymore. the dinner here was filling and great !", "relationMentions": [{"em1Text": "Delhi Bistro", "em2Text": "Dinner", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Porruthai", "em2Text": "Dinner", "label": "ORDER"}, {"em1Text": "Delhi Bistro", "em2Text": "Butter Chicken", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Porruthai", "em2Text": "Butter Chicken", "label": "ORDER"}, {"em1Text": "Delhi Bistro", "em2Text": "Garlic Naan", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Porruthai", "em2Text": "Garlic Naan", "label": "ORDER"}, {"em1Text": "Delhi Bistro", "em2Text": "Food", "label": "HAS_ASPECT"}, {"em1Text": "Terrific", "em2Text": "Delhi Bistro", "label": "ASPECT_ATTR_FOR"}, {"em1Text": "Food", "em2Text": "Terrific", "label": "IS"}, {"em1Text": "Delhi Bistro", "em2Text": "Price", "label": "HAS_ASPECT"}, {"em1Text": "Pricey", "em2Text": "Delhi Bistro", "label": "ASPECT_ATTR_FOR"}, {"em1Text": "Price", "em2Text": "Pricey", "label": "IS"}]}, {"sentText": "Delhi Bistro, Allyssa, Delhi Bistro is clean  and Allyssa really love Delhi Bistro's vegetarian options.

For desert masala tea and gulab jamun  desert masala tea and gulab jamun were outstanding. Service was attentive friendly  and Cybill were provided with scented hot cloths to clean after eating. Cybill's only wish was that Maharaja Restaurant served Maharaja Restaurant's dishes thali  but Cybill left so stuffed that Cybill really did not  need it.

Once for a lunchtime buffet  which was spectacular  and most recently for a quiet dinner for my companion and Jenny. Jenny would give Maharaja Restaurant five stars if it were not  for the quirky service. As is the case with most establishments in Madison Jenny have  noticed lately  the quirky service is often mediocre  inconsistent  or just downright bad. Unfortunately  in this instance Maharaja Restaurant was no exception. Jenny's dining partner and Jenny were promptly greeted by a waiter at My dining partner and Jenny's table. Being that the menu is quite extensive and wanting plenty of time to pour over the menu  Jenny indicated Jenny's indecision and told My dining partner and Jenny's server that Jenny were not  in any rush. Jenny must have  taken that to mean to disappear for the next    minutes. During the next    minutes  Jenny's companion and Jenny decided on an appetizer and Jenny had some questions. Feeling like Jenny were stranded on an island  Jenny closed Jenny's menu a couple times as a lifeline signal. That did not  work. Frustrated  Jenny finally flagged someone over. Jenny was irritated that Jenny could have  spent all those wasted minutes noshing while pondering Jenny's meal selection. After a bit of a communication issue over the menu  Jenny each put in my companion and Jenny's individual dinner orders. Jenny's companion relayed the drink choice :  chardonnay  plus a Coke for My dining partner. Seeming confused  a waiter attempted to clarify. Jenny interjected with a chuckle well  not in the same glass of course   referring to the soda and wine. Moments later  a waiter returned with a wine for Jenny and what appeared to be a watery - Coke for My dining partner. It was obvious after the first sip :  the soda and wine were indeed combined. Ummmm did this just happen   !  ! Again a waiter remained MIA. Finally a waiter returned with Jenny's companion  entree. But not Jenny. About a third of the way into My dining partner's meal  Jenny's dinner finally arrived. Sorry but that is just not acceptable. There was no apology and no indication of the extended wait time. my companion and Jenny's service throughout HIS meal was spotty  with intervals of more frequent attention and drink refills. It is important to note that Jenny showed up just as Maharaja Restaurant opened at  pm so Maharaja Restaurant was not busy at all until a bit later into my companion and Jenny's meal.

The waitstaff was not rude and in fact The waitstaff were very friendly but the wait was too long. Jeff ordered an appetizer and two dosas. The waitstaff took a    minutes to bring us our appetizer and another    minutes    hour  before Jeff got our dosa. Cafe Krishna was not busy when Jeff ordered. There were only   couples in Cafe Krishna at the time and only   couples had   waiters. waiters never checked on us and Jeff had to flag waiters down to get our bill. One of waiters is an Eastern European woman who spoke no English and had never waited tables before. One of the waiters brought our chaat to our table and did not  even bring plates with our chaat. The food itself was good but not noteworthy. Cafe Krishna's chutneys were not tasty or flavorful. The coconut chutney at Woodlands  Ray and Rural is a lot better. our dosa had very little sabji  potato  filling and was nearly entirely just one large crepe. The dosa at Woodlands  Ray and Rural includes much more sabji. Jeff did like the sabji and thought the sabji was better than Woodlands  Ray and Rural because the sabji was slightly less greasy. The samosa chaat was not good. The samosa chaat had very little samosa maybe two small pieces of one samosa   and the rest of The samosa chaat included vegetables. The samosa chaat was not  bad but neither was The samosa chaat tasty. The only positive aspect to Cafe Krishna was Cafe Krishna is  ambience. Despite Cafe Krishna's  cafe  name  Cafe Krishna is a sit - down restaurant. Cafe Krishna  nicer than many full fledged Indian restaurants in the valley. Cafe Krishna was clean  spacious with many booths. and decorated well. You are seated  given a menu and a waiter takes your order. Cafe Krishna  not like Woodlands in which you order at the register. Cafe Krishna has a full menu but Cafe Krishna is  vegetarian. Cafe Krishna  also a South Indian place so Jeff would not  recommend ordering saag paneer and North Indian dishes because South Indians do not  know how to cook North Indian food. Jeff will not come back because the service was too slow.

Jeff m pretty forgiving of slow service if the restaurant is super busy or if there is only one server but this was different. You could tell waiters had no previous experience waiting tables and had no sense of urgency. waiters did not  know how to refill drinks  check up on you  bring your bill to you on time. It seemed like waiters were related to the owner or were part owners and tried to be servers. If Cafe Krishna improved Cafe Krishna's speed and service  Jeff would recommend Cafe Krishna.

My sweetheart discovered Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine through a local Yelp event and suggested La- give Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine a shot. A regular patron of another traditional  homestyle Indian restaurant down in Georgia La- thought La- should try out the buffet - style Indian meal for lunch that is prevalent with many of these food establishments. The decor was simple yet elegant. Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine was dead; somebody ran to the back to grab the hostess to have my family seated and so there was this odd moment of waiting. However the water was brought out immediately  and La- ordered a sweet lassi drink. a sweet lassi drink was rather delicious; cold  creamy  and not full of ice. La- had to try everything. Mind you  La- went back to the buffet line twice after just to make sure what La- grabbed was not  a bad batch or to verify that the food was indeed that good. Mixed results. the food was uncovered  so the heat retention was not  there and the Sterno cans could not maintain proper heat distribution. Scary thought of food - borne illness. La- dove in anyway; trying to get the pieces closer to the bottom of the pan whilst crossing my fingers. The basmati rice was great and La- grabbed small portions of each entree to sample and stir up the taste buds. Lets narrow down to what La- like and did not  like. Here are my personal downs : the salad was slightly browning and the cucumbers were sliced rather thick than La- would have preferred  nor did the raita yoghurt dressing helped much with flavor in a bland salad. The daal makahni  black lentils with herbs and spices La- could not  care for much  though others may find The daal makahni  black lentils with herbs and spices to others's liking. La- can not  remember how the aloo saag  spinach and potatoes  tasted  but the aloo saag  spinach and potatoes is  another one of those dishes La- can pass on since the mushy texture of spinach did not  jibe with my appetite. The naan flatbread was a little more than crispy for me  however the tender baked portions were just fantastic ! La- fancied the onion pakora  onion fritters   chana masala  garbanzo beans with herbs and spices navaratan korma  mixed vegetables in a cheesy cream sauce chicken chilli  saut ed chicken with onions bell peppers  and tomatoes ... not a fan of spicy foods but this did not  make me break a sweat and was one of my favorite dishes malai wings -  La- want the recipe for this  mint chutney  ! and tamarind chutney  !  . The chutneys were not overbearing in flavor and La- could not  help but to swipe the tasty wings in The chutneys with every bite. Had a small helping of the gulab jamun  milk balls in sugar syrup  which tasted like doughnut holes bathed in diabetes. The kheer was a delightful sweet rice pudding to end the meal with. Cheap eats  great variety of food  local  ambient music  clean interior. The basement bathroom could use a little spiffying and The basement bathroom ran ice cold water. Service was excellent  and as Service should be since there were only two other tables by the time La- finished our meal. La- will have to come back for dinner next time when La- m back in town. Oh  and that gentleman in the back corner staring at my table : please do not ; it is rude and downright creepy.

Let me tell you  Chicken Vindaloo IS spicy. You will need naan for this. Wow... the rice was cooked perfectly. There was plenty of chicken and potatoes in the dish. Very filling. naan was PERFECT  AMAZING  and absolutely wonderful.

First came the papad  which is a fried appetizer of sorts. the papad  which is a fried appetizer of sorts kind of resembles a chip  but with Indian spices and sauces. Next  Meera ordered a variety of appetizers. Meera got the vegetable platter  which included a samosa  a veggie pakora  a paneer pakora and sort of a potato patty. For     Meera was expecting something more than just   pieces but it was still very good. Everything was perfectly spiced. For entrees  Meera ordered the Shahi paneer at a medium spice level. It was the perfect amount of heat  and you were not  overwhelmed. the Shahi paneer was so delicious  and Meera was definitely eating the Shahi paneer with a spoon. Meera got two orders of garlic naan which was THE MOST DELICIOUS THING EVER. Seriously  if you have not  ever tried garlic naan you are  missing out on life. garlic naan was a perfect accompaniment with every entree. The rest of the table got the chana masala  indo - chinese chili paneer  and malai kofta. All were very good. Meera also got a few drinks as well  such as their chai and mango lassi. Delicious ! For dessert  Meera were given the option of kheer  kind of like a rice pudding  and gulab jamun  sort of like fried donuts soaked in a sugar syrup . They were both good  but by that time  Meera could not  eat anymore. Meera m glad Meera had a Groupon  because otherwise  a Groupon might have been a tad pricey.

The toilet paper is on a weird stick that falls on the floor and lands in... whatever it is that ends up on mens  room floors next to a toilet. So do yourself a favor do not  use The toilet paper. All of which might be tolerable except the light is on a very short timer  with a sensor that does not  reach into The lone toilet stall. So you WILL be left in the dark. And no gesture or flailing above below the divider will trigger the light. So you have  got to try to get yourself out of The lone toilet stall completely blind. A job for Houdini. Houdini m not docking a star  because M. avoid all restaurant bathrooms anyway  and M. m really more interested in the incoming food  not the outgoing.

Arun was there for Sunday afternoon lunch buffet at    :    AM. There were only two people in the hall and lunch was served fresh and hot  just like lunch should be served ! This was menu for Sunday afternoon lunch buffet : salad  raita tamarind chutney  mint chutney tandoori chicken  lamb biryani dum aloo chole  tadka daal  basmati rice  rice pudding and gulab jamun. Naan was served fresh on the table  which was very very nice ! Ambiance is good in Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine. Parking is easy to find on the street or in nearby lots. Food is very good. Arun really liked Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine a lot actually. Arun was particularly impressed by the taste of daal. Arun enjoyed everything on the menu. Unlike some indian places in Cleveland metro area  Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine is not extra spicy and reasonably priced. Arun had a chat with the chef and the chef seemed to be very open to criticism and suggestions  !  ! Arun have a feeling Arun will be a regular here.", "relationMentions": [{"em1Text": "Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine", "em2Text": "Naan", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Fresh", "em2Text": "Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine", "label": "MENU_ATTR_FOR"}, {"em1Text": "Naan", "em2Text": "Fresh", "label": "SERVE"}, {"em1Text": "Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine", "em2Text": "Parking", "label": "HAS_ASPECT"}, {"em1Text": "Easy", "em2Text": "Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine", "label": "ASPECT_ATTR_FOR"}, {"em1Text": "Parking", "em2Text": "Easy", "label": "IS"}, {"em1Text": "Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine", "em2Text": "Food", "label": "HAS_ASPECT"}, {"em1Text": "Good", "em2Text": "Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine", "label": "ASPECT_ATTR_FOR"}, {"em1Text": "Food", "em2Text": "Good", "label": "IS"}]}, {"sentText": "Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine, Joyce, stars for Joyce's first visit. Joyce think Joyce will  have to come back and try a few more things... Joyce keep seeing these   star ratings and these   star ratings have Joyce curious. Arrived the evening of hurricane Sandy. There were a few booths full but most of Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine was empty. Joyce grabbed a booth and were promptly served papad  yum  -  only gave us   pieces though  and water. Joyce ordered the vegetarian indo - chinese chili  cauliflower  and the lamb curry. Joyce also got the vegetable pakora  fried vegetable fritters  and the garlic naan. the garlic naan was really good and so was the pakora. the lamb curry had good flavor but the lamb curry was not  as spicy as Joyce thought the lamb curry would be  though Joyce ordered medium . It was also the first time Joyce had indo - chinese chili  and Joyce thought there was a little bit too saucy. The flavor was sweet and sour which was good  but too overwhelming with all the sauce. Maybe someone who has had a lot of indo - chinese flavors can tell Joyce more. The service was pretty good  quick  and attentive. Joyce think Joyce will  be coming back to try more  and Joyce will  definitely be back for the    lunch buffet.", "relationMentions": [{"em1Text": "Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine", "em2Text": "Cauliflower", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Joyce", "em2Text": "Cauliflower", "label": "ORDER"}, {"em1Text": "Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine", "em2Text": "Vegetable Pakora", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Joyce", "em2Text": "Vegetable Pakora", "label": "ORDER"}, {"em1Text": "Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine", "em2Text": "Garlic Naan", "label": "HAS_MENU"}, {"em1Text": "Good", "em2Text": "Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine", "label": "MENU_ATTR_FOR"}, {"em1Text": "Garlic Naan", "em2Text": "Good", "label": "IS"}]}, {"sentText": "Charkha Exotic Indian Cuisine, Frank, Frank enjoy eating at Charkha.
