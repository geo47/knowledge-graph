silver spoon have expanded to another location in scarborough  so that there are now two silver spoons the pickering location has managed to maintain consistent quality  although consistent quality can vary on days. well  what restaurant does not  have that problem you might be suddenly short - staffed  someone down with the flu   or perhaps one of your deliveries did not  make it on time it is good food. katya prefer the pakistani cuisine :  nihari haleem not always available  and several of the biryanis. silver spoon are now offering sindhi biryani on weekends  and katya m so pleased ! the only way that katya could get sindhi biryani in the past was to make sindhi biryani katya using a packaged spice blend. if you want to get naan  katya recommend the butter naan. although the butter naan costs a bit more the butter enhancements really take naan to the next level of browning and savoury tastes. ok  things sit under the heat lamp but things do not seem to suffer that much  particularly something like nihari  which is a stew - type dish that can withstand the warming table. everything has always tasted fresh when katya have ordered it. katya find that the samosa are fairly standard  but there are other appetizers which are more exciting. for people who like the dark meat of the chicken lollypop chicken is great and consistently good. katya also enjoy shami kebab. if you like fish  do not  skip the fingerfish  which is consistently tasty. whenever katya have been there  which is perhaps once a month or two  for the past five years the portions have been generous. katya am certainly a fan  and silver spoon fills an important niche in the local  pickering community as a convenient place to pick up some halal take - away of decent quality.",

is not  working out anymore. to start :  the food is not  exactly terrible. the food just...not very good. heli have  tried almost every meat dish  the chana masala  samosas  biriyanis  etc. indian take - out is hardly known for indian take - out's healthiness but when you order a veal karahi and get two sad chunks of meat floating in half a container in oil it is  a little disheartening. add to that the fact that food is often sitting under a heat lamp for god knows how long... on the upside :  the chicken biriyani is good bang for your buck  -  especially during the week when the chicken biriyani is  on special. you get a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat. a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat  ready to go so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for your order. there was that one time they ran out of chicken biriyani  which is understandable when the chicken biriyani is  on special  but then offered me a  regular biriyani read : just rice  for the same price. ummm  say what   heli do love their beef samosas -  it is  just to bad that they never have any. seriously  heli have been here early in the evening  at random times during the week  and they have loads of sad looking veggie samosas  but no beef. heli feel like the owners need to do a serious evaluation of what works and does not  work. if you notice you are  always selling out of a certain item  and not another   does not  it make sense to up a certain item while downsizing another who knows. my biggest gripe was the chana masala incident. the last time heli went in  heli ordered a chana masala  which heli m apathetic about  but my husband likes . the girl at the counter kind of made a face and said oh... no. heli do not  want a chana masala  which heli m apathetic about but my husband likes. heli was confused. there was a whole tray of a chana masala  which heli m apathetic about but my husband likes there  brimming with chick - pea goodness. a chana masala  which heli m apathetic about but my husband likes not... good today. what what does that mean  is the taste just  off  or had a chana masala  which heli m apathetic about but my husband likes spoiled  in either event why is there a full tray of  not good  chana masala here for customers to look at  and possible walk out the door with   heli stared at a full tray of  not good  chana masala  and the girl at the counter motioned at a full tray of  not good  chana masala again heli was just going to remove a full tray of  not good  chana masala from here anyway. but  um  heli did not . and heli was the only person in the store. from the wide glass window  before heli even stepped in  heli could see that there was no one else even there. she had not  even come over until heli would  been standing there for a few minutes. it really bothers me that heli still really do not  know what was so wrong with an entire tray of food that an entire tray of food would warrant being thrown out  -  and why an entire tray of food hadn t been thrown out immediately if an entire tray of food really could not  be saved. it was clear from the crispiness on the top you know that kind of layer of  kin  that develops   that an entire tray of food had been sitting for a while. ultimately  heli m really quite relieved the staff person told me before heli bought a full tray of  not good  chana masala took a full tray of  not good  chana masala home and got diarrhea or something this would be a much harsher review if that had happened... and heli guess that says something positive about the customer service  sorta... as more and more indian food places -  both takeout and dine - in  -  emerge in the region  store owners need to realize that customers are going to eventually become more discerning. heli really wanted this place to be a favorite  -  after all  this place is  very convenient for me  -  but  sorry silver spoon silver spoon just do not  make the cut.",

have  been going here quite a bit lately since pierre moved back to scarborough and pierre must say it does the trick when your hungry. pierre have to say pierre have  definitely had better indian food for some reason the taste does seen rather bland for authentic indian cuisine pierre think the chiefs play it safe with the level of spice. most dishes are delicious it just seems like something is missing for authentic indian cuisine to be considered real great indian cuisine. pierre do not know enough about how to cook indian food to say exactly what it is. pierre like the fact that the dishes are not salty  the only time pierre feel bad from the food is when pierre eat to much. the tandoori although good seems a little short on flavor  small pieces the butter chicken is quite disappointing the butter chicken is very rich and does not  taste  like butter chicken pierre remember from other restaurants  not to mention the butter chicken has bones in the butter chicken what a sin. there always seems to be more sauce than chicken. the pieces pierre thought were quite small. the beef dish is good  the curry goat and chicken not so much the meat on these dishes seems very tough pierre think bombay buffet use the cheapest meat for bombay buffet. pierre have not   tried the dishes on the menu yet bet pierre assume the dishes on the menu are allot better. the veggie dishes seem old like the veggie dishes have  been sitting the veggie dishes's for days overall bombay buffet does not seem to heat the food pierre have never seen the food really hot there not cold just lukewarm. the only hot item is when bombay buffet bring the naan bread from the oven. pierre really wish bombay buffet had more of those famous  indian deserts  instead of ice cream which pierre do not  think is sanitary to leave ice cream there and everybody dig in to ice cream and they need to cover ice cream separately as well not just the door. the service unfortunately is not that great either the owner is very friendly however the waiters seem disengaged like the waiters just want to go home no small talk no smile nothing. the worst thing for m about being served in a restaurant is when pierre have to ask for everything pierre do not  mind sometimes but pierre always have to ask for another drink  more water napkins remove bottles etc. every single time. bombay buffet does give the appearance of being clean especially the washrooms which is one of the reasons pierre go back. pierre must say pierre have seen attitude from some of the staff again not the owner. on one occasion a girl working there who pierre never seen  before or ever since actually spoke rather rudely to pierre in an unfriendly tone for putting a little sauce back on the buffet dish from pierre's plate omg call the police lol. last thing pierre want to address is the decor definitely needs an upgrade seating could be set up better to maximize space the carpet looks old and decrepit and the t.v looks nice but pierre have  never seen the t.v on. pierre do not  think they want to pay for cable and no clock whats up with that oh pierre get it do not  let people know what time it is so people wo not  leave to soon or have another beverage. the thing pierre hate about the buffet section is there is no light pierre think it should be the other way around lots of light to see bombay buffet and less light in the dinning room perhaps candles would make for a better dinning experience  flowers would create ambience sometimes the music is too loud for dinning. pierre think rather than everybody so close to each other in the dinning room they should use the other room as well especially on the weekends where seating is an issue. one more thing  through the week business is petty slow sometimes only pierre and a few people are there. so why play games with the few customers you have  one time a waiter who is no longer there charged pierre imported price for domestic beer pierre brought domestic beer to the owner  attention and the owner adjusted the bill the next time pierre went no apologies were given everybody know budweiser is domestic duh. another time pierre specifically asked for a canada dry ginger ale and a canada dry ginger ale is  the name a canada dry ginger ale is listed as on the menu the owner brings a canada dry ginger ale to pierre and life is good. the next one pierre ordered the owner brings no name ginger ale pierre was so angry pierre just left as soon as pierre finished the meal pierre did not  want to lose it. ant the no name of course tastes like crap tastes is  why no name ginger ale's cheap but the owner still charged pierre the   . . one time the said waiter who is no longer there when pierre asked the said waiter who is no longer there when pierre asked him to remove the bottles from the table to remove the bottles from the table the owner said pierre have a big table with lots of room. what the hell is the owner talking to pierre like that for. unbelievable this is not how you talk to customers who pay your bills. as you can imagine it was reflected in the tip. another time they tried to give pierre a bottle of beer that was opened for days flat as hell they corrected that when pierre  spoke up about a bottle of beer that was opened for days flat as hell. look pierre m not saying to avoid bombay buffet at all  pierre just know they could make it a whole lot better. pierre usually go alone and pierre have  noticed the more people the better the service. the  bigger the tip by all means check it out bombay buffet used to be    . they just raised it to    . but the bombay buffet items did not change at all  nothing new added go figure.", "relationMentions": [{"em1Text": "bombay buffet indian cuisine", "em2Text": "butter

the gobi     which was fried cauliflower was magnificently prepared with the best spices. the gobi     which was fried cauliflower was preceded by paneer  which is an indian cheese  cut into square pieces and served with onions and peppers. michael also ordered one of the curry dishes and a rava dosa  which was served with chutney and lentil soup. a rava dosa  which was served with chutney and lentil soup was served flat on the plate  as opposed to the rolled up dosas that michael have had in the past. finally  michael shared some cheese bread. michael can not  say enough greats things about the quality of the food and the flavors. there were two things that michael thought could have been better. the dishes could have been served a little warmer than what the dishes were. the second thing is that the service was painfully slow. it took at least    minutes for our first dish to be served. and the service stayed slow  all the way til the end of our meal. perhaps they are

eating a chicken wrap. since its a wrap unless you disassemble a chicken wrap you would not know by the looks of a chicken wrap whether it was red or white meat inside so a coworker of mine took a bite and ate a chicken wrap. never in a coworker of mine's life a coworker of mine tasted beef so a coworker of mine ask us taste a chicken wrap since a chicken wrap tasted weird for a coworker of mine. so lia disassembled a chicken wrap at this point and tasted the meat inside a chicken wrap. the meat inside it was beef !  !  !  !  ! at that point lia's coworker talked to the cashier and informed the cashier that instead of giving a coworker of mine's chicken  a coworker of mine gave a coworker of mine's beef. instead of apologizing  lia raised lia's voice to lia's coworker and told a coworker of mine a coworker of mine made a mistake on a coworker of mine's order which was not true at all. unfortunately  lia do not  have a proof since the receipt just says lunch special. lia did not apologized   lia did not even offer to give a coworker of mine a replacement. at this point lia's coworker even though clearly upset but hungry  ordered another chicken wrap despite us telling a

lived all over india  and have had indian enough to know ...  good from great . soma grill is truly  great  food. malinda have  been to soma grill with my husband over a dozen times and malinda will  keep coming back. why  you ask well  the answer is simple. the food is hand made every day  the staff is full of heart and spirt  and the owner is a wonderful woman who truly cares about the owner's guests. here  some things malinda would  like to brag about eating there : start with the :  vegetable samosa   comes with an order of two and two dipping sauces   -  these triangular delights are a perfect way to start your meal. the green dipping sauce is perfectly spicy and compliments the brown sweet dipping sauce. yum ! ! ! for dinner malinda share. here  what malinda love there ... but first  you must know dinner comes with a cup of mildly spicy and delicious lentil soup  as well as a fresh salad. a fresh salad has a zesty yogurt dressing lightly garnishing the top of a fresh salad. now for the main course. chicken tikka masala  chicken tikka masala comes in a light red orange cream sauce  chicken tikka masala is tender and a light red orange cream sauce has a bold rich tomato flavor. mmmmm ... get the naan to dip in a light red orange cream sauce so no drop goes to waste. lamb kashmiri  lamb kashmiri has a mild burgandy sauce with almonds in lamb kashmiri lamb kashmiri tastes like lamb kashmiri has been cooking all day. if you have  ever had  osso bucco  from an italian restaurant ... you know osso bucco  from an italian restaurant. lamb kashmiri is as tender as osso bucco  from an italian restaurant. and a mild burgandy sauce with almonds in it  a mild burgandy sauce with almonds in it has a ton of flavor. if you eat lamb lamb is something you must try. fish cod  madras this dish is perfectly cooked white fish in a very fresh rich colored tomato sauce with onions and mushrooms what malinda really like about this dish is how much this dish complements the heavier flavors in a light red orange cream sauce. if you are  looking for a vegetable dish my husband and malinda have tried a few of a vegetable dish. my husband and malinda's favorite is the  aloo gobi    aloo gobi the  aloo gobi has potato  and cauliflower mixed in a light  fresh crushed tomato sauce the  aloo gobi  very good and a nice compliment to all the meat dishes malinda order  to share. malinda have  had both the garlic and regular naan. both the garlic and regular naan are  perfect for dipping  and in my opinion naan is a  must have  when eating an indian meal. rice comes with the meals so if you do not  want bread but want a starch you will  be happy to know white rice accompanies all entrees. as for dessert malinda have  had the rice pudding and pistachio ice - cream this is the kulfi  on the menu. between those two  malinda would  pick the pistachio ice - cream every time. the pistachio ice - cream very refreshing after a hot meal. also  each time malinda visit malinda always get the hot chai tea. the hot chai tea is made to order and is worth the wait. you add the sugar which puts you in the drivers seat  as far as sweetness goes. malinda recommend soma grill to anyone looking to try something other than a chain restaurant. soma grill is worth a try and if you already like indian food take malinda's dinner suggestions. you wo not  be sorry ! hope

familiar and delish as well. an indian couple seem to own and run soma grill the wife is the cook and the wife really aims to please. the wife came out to our table   times to talk to us although

the highlight was aloo bonda and the fried baby corn. sujith cannot finish this review without mentioning the awesome sambar. the awesome sambar is hands down the best in the valley. sujith had sambar with uttapam and also with rice. the last time sujith had sambar with rice was at bheemas in ca so this was worth it. the weekend buffet runs at   . which is a little bit on the expensive side. sujith would see if sujith can cut down on the number of items to bring down the price because it is humanly impossible to taste all the items present.", "relationMentions": [{"em1Text": "hyderabad house

finished eating. service aside  let  move on to the most important part :  quality of food. the vegetable pakora  the first appetizer  was literally a cauliflower fried in unseasoned batter which was disgusting. hell  anyone could make better pakora than what was prepared by armaan taste of india. on some pieces  hello could see the raw cauliflower which had none of unseasoned batter. unappetizing much  hello decided to clear my mind; perhaps the main dishes would be somewhat decent. oh boy  was hello wrong ! the paneer tikka masala tasted like someone had dumped heaps of tomato paste  tomato pur e  and chunks of tomato  with sugar and small sprinkles of indian spices. this was despite my request for extremely spicy paneer tikka masala. the malai kofta gravy tasted like raw sewage diluted with turmeric and chilly power. by far  the most disgusting dish. the channa masala which my uncle had ordered looked like little shit pieces in brown gravy. the next morning  my uncle said one of my uncles threw up all of the disgusting channa masala. hello presume the high ratings are from non - indians who do not  know how delicious indian food can be when prepared properly. to you  hello

better. h. myone wouldnt go there for dinner . the owner needs to add some interiors to matka indian cuisine otherwise matka indian cuisine would compete only with the c - fu next door instead of

attentive waiter service. very attentive waiter service were great with refills and prompt delivery of our food  and also patience with the fact that jenn food blogger types have to take pictures of everything before jenn eat it . star of india do have a wine list  and while a wine list is  small  a wine list is  also relatively cheap. the bottles were all less than     each  and jenn got a nice

with crunchy crackers  the same consistency and flavor of the samosa shell   yogurt  and tamarind sauce. getable chat  like a less - mayonnaise - d version of potato salad. oh  how jenn love getable chat ! star of india  was absolutely perfect  and jenn m so glad jenn took a chance on ordering star of india. however  not wanting to step totally out of jenn's comfort zone jenn ordered jenn's

although consistent quality can vary on days. well  what restaurant does not  have that problem you might be suddenly short - staffed  someone down with the flu   or perhaps one of your deliveries did

naan. although the butter naan costs a bit more the butter enhancements really take naan to the next level of browning and savoury tastes. ok  things sit under the heat lamp but things do not seem to suffer that much  particularly something like nihari  which is a stew - type dish that can withstand the warming table. everything has always tasted fresh when katya have ordered it. katya find that the samosa are fairly standard  but there are other appetizers which are more exciting. for people who like the dark meat of the chicken lollypop chicken is great and consistently good. katya also enjoy shami kebab. if you like fish  do not  skip the fingerfish  which is consistently tasty. whenever katya have been there  which is perhaps once a month or two  for the past five years the

chances. but this just is not  working out anymore. to start :  the food is not  exactly terrible. the food just...not very good. heli have  tried almost every meat dish  the chana masala  samosas  biriyanis  etc. indian take - out is hardly known for indian take - out's healthiness but when you order a veal karahi and get two sad chunks of meat floating in half a container in oil it is  a little disheartening. add to that the fact that food is often sitting under a heat lamp for god knows how long... on the upside :  the chicken biriyani is good bang for your buck  -  especially during the week when the chicken biriyani is  on special. you get a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat. a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat  ready to go so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for your order. there was that one time they ran out of chicken biriyani  which is understandable when the chicken biriyani is  on special  but then offered me a  regular biriyani read : just rice  for the same price. ummm  say what   heli do love their beef samosas -  it is  just to bad that they never have any. seriously  heli have been here early in the evening  at random times during the week  and they have loads of sad looking veggie samosas  but no beef. heli feel like the owners need to do a serious evaluation of what works and does not  work. if you notice you are  always selling out of a certain item  and not another   does not  it make sense to up a certain item while downsizing another who knows. my biggest gripe was the chana masala incident. the last time heli went in  heli ordered a chana masala  which heli m apathetic about  but my husband likes . the girl at the counter kind of made a face and said oh... no. heli do not  want a chana masala  which heli m apathetic about but my husband likes. heli was confused. there was a whole tray of a chana masala  which heli m apathetic about but my husband likes there  brimming with chick - pea goodness. a chana masala  which heli m apathetic about but my husband likes not... good today. what what does that mean  is the taste just  off  or had a chana masala  which heli m apathetic about but my husband likes spoiled  in either event why is there a full tray of  not good  chana masala here for customers to look at  and possible walk out the door with   heli stared at a full tray of  not good  chana masala  and the girl at the counter motioned at a full tray of  not good  chana masala again heli was just going to remove a full tray of  not good  chana masala from here anyway. but  um  heli did not . and heli was the only person in the store. from the wide glass window  before heli even stepped in  heli could see that there was no one else even there. she had not  even come over until heli would  been standing there for a few minutes. it really bothers me that heli still really do not  know what was so wrong with an entire tray of food that an entire tray of food would warrant being thrown out  -  and why an entire tray of food hadn t been thrown out immediately if an entire tray of food really could not  be saved. it was clear from the crispiness on the top you know that kind of layer of  kin  that develops   that an entire tray of food had been sitting for a while. ultimately  heli m really quite relieved the staff person told me before heli bought a full tray of  not good  chana masala took a full tray of  not good  chana masala home and got diarrhea or something this would be a much harsher review if that had happened... and heli guess that says something positive about the customer service  sorta... as more and more indian food places -  both takeout and dine - in  -  emerge in the region  store owners need to realize that customers are going to eventually become more discerning. heli really wanted this place to be a favorite  -  after all  this place is  very convenient for me  -  but  sorry silver spoon silver spoon

a chef at lolas making the lolas beef tips. if anyone has ever tasted the lolas beef tips the lolas beef tips is also close as you get to original portuguese cuisine. now about nirvana  ; -  it is more about carrying out than dining in. once you set that expectation you would be fine. another thing to keep in mind is that not all indian food is spicy. anything that involves cream will be bland for the most part. what the reader avi a said about the food being bland; -  any lentils or korma will always have some blandness associated for any lentils or korma. if you want something with a flavor and a kick here are some options; -   chilli chicken pepper chicken any south indian chicken curry fish  - yes this is really good for you non vegetarians ; -   chama masalla any peas and mushroom combinations any kadai combinations the coconut chicken is also good but dont expect the coconut chicken to be spicy. the staff is very friendly and the staff do take feedback. so if you have

what tandoori grill have and can tandoori grill tell julia if julia can order it or not the friendly lady on the phone was very accommodating and everything julia wanted  tandoori grill could provide julia with. julia ordered vegetable samosa  vegetable pakoras butter chicken  lamb biryani and three plain naan. what julia did not  realize is that butter chicken along with lamb chops  tandoori mix platter and shish kabab are chef  specials so butter chicken along with lamb chops  tandoori mix platter and shish kabab come with a piece of naan already and a salad  julia loved everything about tandoori grill except that salad is pretty much nonexistent . julia was greeted with all smiles when julia arrived to pick up julia's order  the couple who run tandoori grill are very nice. the woman who took julia's order on the phone remembered julia did not have a menu so gave julia one and told julia one is posted on tandoori grill's facebook page. julia got home and ripped into our meal  and julia was very impressed. this ai not no pre made frozen samosa  pakoras or naan. you can tell three plain naan was made with tender love and care  nice and pillowy  julia wanted to take a nap on three plain naan. three plain naan also wasn;t covered in burned bits  like some naan  which julia assume comes from a dirty tandoori oven. the samosa and pakoras were exceptional and very tasty. butter chicken was also excellent  julia am not a fan of the giant chicken chunks  and butter chicken was nicely cut in bite size portions and the sauce was tangy and flavourful. the lamb in lamb biryani was cooked perfectly  nice and moist. so those who drive past tandoori grill or live in the area and go  julia wonder if tandoori grill is  good tandoori grill is ! and tandoori grill's prices

had to save room for the main course. next alexandra ordered a meat and veggie curry  chicken masala and blank lentil curry  with both garlic and butter naan personally  they taste similar so if you are  pinching pennies just go for butter naan . alexandra were greatly surprised with how incredible everything tasted. alexandra's host always came by alexandra's table to make sure alexandra's

apparently not allowed in the indian eating playbook. stephen's co - worker described it as eating mashed potatoes with rice  -  personally stephen do not  see the problem . what stephen found really unusual is that about two minutes after ordering stephen got a phone call from an unknown number and an unknown number was a lady working at tandoori grill. a lady working at the tandoori grill called to ask stephen if stephen wanted stephen's biryani medium hot or very hot. stephen told a lady working at the tandoori grill to make stephen sweat and stephen think a lady working at the tandoori

did catch a few cloves and some bark looking thing that tasted really bitter. minor grievances for stephen since stephen do like to experience ethnic and exotic flavours. and boy did a lady working at the tandoori grill make stephen sweat ! the biryani was spicy too  har har  ! you vanilla faces out there might want to opt for the medium spicy; a caramel face like stephen has been desensitized to

having been there before. spicy garden was very clean  with definite thought given to decor with all the ikea hanging lampshades they were using. on to the food ! karen had the spicy garlic chicken combo  which came with   spring rolls and a bowl of fried rice. super saucy with breaded chicken with a spicy kick  -  and super yummy as well. karen m sure karen's stomach is currently glowing neon red from the plentiful sauce right now. karen also tried out karen's fellow diners  chili chicken and paneer with chili. my fellow diners  chili chicken and paneer with chili were also unexpectedly delicious. paneer with chili was breaded which karen was not  used to but karen guess that is  how it is  - did not  deter karen from enjoying every firm and faintly cheesy bite. to end off  karen all shared a deep fried banana dessert with vanilla ice cream which was just the perfect sweet and cooling way to end off a spicy  fragrant meal. spicy garden is a great value for money  with a good

that din could come in   the owner would give din the groupon price for all three  with drinks included. the groupon price for all three  with drinks included would have been    per person for the buffet. so din was happy with that. din got there this place looked dingy dark   gloomy. with the rain outside  it only made it worse. the food seemed like leftovers from lunch. all the dishes were with curry stains from lunch. not cleaned up. the rice was just warming up in a rice cooker the rice was at the very bottom of a rice cooker  making it obvious that the rice was leftover. din understand that this place can not  waste food  but at least  clean up the dishes  so that this place respect this place's customers. this place needs cleaning up   the floor needs to be mopped. din

food. din cook better indian food at home. and this charge was for an    year old lady  who barely eats anything at all. specially for dinner. all din can say is  this place lost a customer many more

and seeing literally no one in the seating area at   : pm on a sunday  sam were a little nervous. sam tracked down a waiter at the bar on the bamboo garden side    restaurant  -    sides    entrances  but the bamboo garden side    restaurant  -    sides    entrances connect in the middle . sam were seated in a booth only slightly above ground level and given menus. being somewhat familiar with indian dishes and starving after christmas shopping  sam made some selections -  birbali shorba very zesty  and samosa very spicy  to start. sam explained   sam m allergic to wheat  sam's sister can not  have nuts . sam were planning on sticking with curry dishes with rice for sam and some naan for sam's sister. a waiter assured sam the sauce were prepared only with spices  no wheat flour  nothing. granted sam have  eaten indian before with success so sam knew which dishes had been previously safe. but sam were trying tadka restaurant. sam's sister tried the alu gobi  not on the menu but still offered if you ask  and the chicken tikka masala  which was delicious . sam tried the lamb saag  again  not on the menu but offered  which was the best buttery spinach version sam have  ever had  as well as the chettinad an earthy dish with whole chilies. the rice was a bit of a disappointment as the rice was a tad over done  and the spices cooked with the rice were not  sam's taste. by the time sam had finished our meal and packed up our many leftovers more customers had joined us so sam did not  feel so strange and alone. all was well...until a couple hours later. sam m not sure where sam went wrong  if there indeed was gluten in one of the sauce  or what not. all sam's cherished leftovers had to be thrown away. sam would have given the restaurant   stars with a warning to fellow celiacs but then sam remembered the bathroom at tadka restaurant. let  just say sam have  seen nicer bathrooms as truck stops. so   stars is the best sam can do for sam's personal review.",

chinese food menu and the waiter  bartender stared at my friend and said  what  my friend do not  like indian food the waiter  bartender also questioned jacqueline's fiance  order when explaining my fiance the dish several times when my fiance acknowledged my fiance understood what my fiance was ordering. jacqueline ordered the potato cashew rolls only to be disappointed that the potato cashew rolls had no flavor. the potato cashew rolls just tasted like unseasoned mashed potatoes. jacqueline then went to the bathroom and when came out the main dishes were on the table. jacqueline asked jacqueline's fiance and jacqueline's friend to taste jacqueline and asked  does this taste like there is milk in there jacqueline am vegan so jacqueline specifically ordered jacqueline's food to ensure there was no dairy. when the waiter  bartender came back the waiter  bartender asked if jacqueline liked my food  and jacqueline said  yes. my food is good  but - and the waiter  bartender cut jacqueline off and said the waiter  bartender changed jacqueline's order and mixed my food with another curry. jacqueline asked the waiter  bartender if there was dairy in my order and the waiter  bartender asked jacqueline why. jacqueline told the waiter bartender jacqueline am a vegan and then the waiter  bartender proceeded to say it was the waiter  bartender's fault jacqueline did not tell the waiter  bartender. why should jacqueline have to tell the waiter  bartender when jacqueline ordered a curry that did not have dairy in a curry that did not have dairy in it to begin with who changes someones order and does not  ask  then not only did the waiter  bartender charge jacqueline for all of the curry the waiter  bartender brought jacqueline the waiter  bartender insisted on not just bringing jacqueline the aloo vindaloo  which by the way tasted burnt  but another chickpea curry. so jacqueline was charged for   aloo vindaloos and a chickpea curry and whatever curry was mixed in the first one but jacqueline was also charged for   different rice dishes because someone brought us plain basmati rice instead of the cumin basmati rice jacqueline ordered. jacqueline's bill ended up being outrageous but jacqueline could not  even discuss my bill because the waiter  bartender would just walk away. a friend came later on and asked for a dirty martini and got something clear in a martini glass. when a friend asked for some olives they told a friend they do not have olives. jacqueline were afraid to ask how they even attempted to make a dirty martini dirty. jacqueline will

morgan a sideways glance and asked  are my mom and morgan here for indian or chinese  chinese is next door. morgan assured the host morgan were there for the curry and were shown to our very long  very low booth. our waiter ending being the manager  possibly the owner so morgan went with morgan's gut and had our waiter select our courses. our waiter asked our likes and dislikes and went about with suggestions. morgan started with an  amuse bouche  for lack of a better term of chana masala. an  amuse bouche  for lack of a better term of chana masala was tasty and pleasant way to start the meal. morgan moved on to our appetizers :  samosas and tandoori lamb. samosas were perfect  -  crisp  flaky exterior; soft  pillowy interior  -  and huge ! it was tandoori lamb that stole the show for the entire evening. four tender chops heartily seasoned with tandoori spice. morgan think four tender chops heartily seasoned with tandoori spice. were too spicy for my mom -  morgan do believe my mom's spice tolerance has decreased with age morgan hope my mom  not reading this... . four tender chops heartily seasoned with tandoori spice. were amazing  -  perfectly cooked with just the right amount of gamey - ness in the lamb. and yes  you do need a little bit of gamey with lamb otherwise you might as well order beef but morgan guess you would not  in an indian restaurant but anyway... . after our starters morgan split a basket of regular and garlic nan do not  kiss anyone for at least    hours after   plain basmati and tikka masala. morgan know  tikka masala is about as authentic as morgan am  but tikka masala is  still tasty and a good intro for my mom. everything was amazing and there was plenty to take home for lunch the next day for both of us. can you believe it all came to

been cleaned up. our server was  if nothing else  friendly though  and also accommodating to luke's companion  food allergies. once ordered  the food took a long time to arrive. perhaps the kitchen was also understaffed. our onion bhaji and chicken pakoras were tasty  but onion bhaji were fried slightly too long and so had an edge of burnt taste. the main course was a two - curry special which arrived with a generous portion of both rice and naan. luke have to give them points for value here      for more than enough food for two people   and the curries were tasty enough  if not terribly memorable. the chicken chettinad is a cashew - based dish  which seems somewhat unusual for the typical tikka - masala butter - chicken menu one finds. the other curry luke chose was a baingan bartha

cindy would try something different than our usual indian restaurant. cindy purchased a voucher from living social worth so when cindy arrived for our  pm reservation waterfalls indian tapas bar & grill had a fair amount of people. cindy ordered the non - vegetarian platter as an appetizer  the curry special which consisted of chicken chettinad and beef kadhai and the mushroom makini. it took    minutes for us to receive the curry special which consisted of chicken chettinad and beef kadhai. cindy both thought the curry special which consisted of chicken chettinad and beef kadhai was average but nothing relatively special. cindy received our meals at  pm  one hour after our arrival. the curry dish cindy's friend ordered was warm but not fresh the mushroom makini was fresh but the flavour was too much like cindy was eating butter. cindy ate about     of the mushroom makini because the butter taste was overwhelming. the service was below average  cindy had ordered water and when cindy wanted more there was no one to ask. upon arrival the table clothes were dirty and the next table was not cleaned. cindy noticed there were only   chefs in the kitchen    waiters and a manager on a friday evening. when cindy received our bill  usually when cindy have a voucher worth and cindy did not spend our maximum cindy would not need to pay tip or the taxes. but in this situation the waiter told us cindy had to and it was not included with a voucher. so cindy had to pay the taxes when a voucher would have covered the overall amount  this has never occurred to cindy as cindy have used vouchers in the past and if cindy have not used over the amount given the amount given would be counted as tip. so cindy gave the waiter     and on top of that the remainder of a voucher which is    equals     tip which is completely ridiculous for the service cindy received. cindy was overall disappointed in this experience  cindy would never go back to waterfalls indian tapas bar & grill again.

hour. the drinks drinks took another half hour to show up. once drinks finally did tanya placed our order and realized tanya may be in for a long night. the server was really nice  but waterfalls indian tapas bar & grill was severely understaffed for a saturday night :    servers    cooks and waterfalls indian tapas bar & grill. two hours after tanya sat down was when tanya had tanya's first bite of tanya's samosa appetizer  which was delicious. it would be another    minutes before our meals would be on the table. half of our party was finished eating before a couple of friends received a couple of friends's food. no apologies no offers no recognition of how ridiculously long everything was taking. many tables that arrived after us received many tables that arrived after us's meals et al before us. the food was fantastic  which is why tanya m giving   stars and not  . the music was cringe - worthy  a catatonic elevator - music band that soullessly covered greats like hallelujah  tanya will survive and what a wonderful world. music that would have complemented the environment would have been more appropriate. after that band a group of people started setting up for a play... our party marveled at the silence and flickering lights as the actors started constructing the actors's set. eventually tanya just could not  stop laughing; from bad music to no music and faulty electricity   plus a now   hour restaurant experience  and tanya were all colossally late for the second location of our party  which other people were going to be at who were not joining us for dinner . after the birthday girl finished the birthday girl's meal  the birthday girl threw down some cash and left to hold the fort down at the tiki bar. not the way for a birthday girl to feel. the bill organizing was a debacle. tanya tried to organize a split bill system with our server at the beginning  who told us tanya would  just sort it all out later. as someone who worked in the industry for years  a split bill system is a very bad idea. tanya figured out tanya's total plus tax and tip and gave tanya's cash before other people were even given other people's bill. the restaurant  grand apologetic gesture came in the form of comp - ing about   orders of naan bread  a total of    . for a group of people ordering multiple drinks and bottles of wine  plus a full meal each  that was pretty measly. tanya do not  blame the server at all the server was a nice fellow who was working really hard  about x harder than anyone else there . the owner really needs to re - evaluate scheduling and have at least two more servers on the floor  a bartender  and three more people in the kitchen in order for waterfalls indian tapas bar & grill to run smoothly. tanya watched people leave after not being acknowledged at the door for over   minutes  and a table sat dirty for over an hour before being cleared. go to waterfalls indian tapas bar & grill... just not when more than

like jenny were stranded on an island  jenny closed jenny's menu a couple times as a lifeline signal. that did not  work. frustrated  jenny finally flagged someone over. jenny was irritated that jenny could have  spent all those wasted minutes noshing while pondering jenny's meal selection. after a bit of a communication issue over the menu  jenny each put in my companion and jenny's individual dinner orders. jenny's companion relayed the drink choice :  chardonnay  plus a coke for my dining partner. seeming confused  a waiter attempted to clarify. jenny interjected with a chuckle well  not in the same glass of course   referring to the soda and wine. moments later  a waiter returned with a wine for jenny and what appeared to be a watery - coke for my dining partner. it was obvious after the first sip :  the soda and wine were indeed combined. ummmm did this just happen   !  ! again a waiter remained mia. finally a waiter returned with jenny's companion  entree. but not jenny. about a third of the way into my dining partner's meal  jenny's dinner finally arrived. sorry but that is just not acceptable. there was no apology and no indication of the extended wait time. my companion

stands virtually alone in the phoenix as the only vegetarian restaurant that fails to offer vegans. this would not  be an issue if servers were more willing to ensure that products were dairy free.

sit down and eat with no worries. a simple  v  next to all the vegan items would make sanjith feel more inclined to eat at cafe krishna a simple  v  next to all the vegan items would make sanjith feel

food. jeff usually eat dosa and south indian fare at woodlands  ray and rural . jeff tried cafe krishna for a change. jeff was disappointed. the service was lousy. the waitstaff was not rude and in fact the waitstaff were very friendly but the wait was too long. jeff ordered an appetizer and two dosas. the waitstaff took a    minutes to bring us our appetizer and another    minutes    hour  before jeff got our dosa. cafe krishna was not busy when jeff ordered. there were only   couples in cafe krishna at the time and only   couples had   waiters. waiters never checked on us and jeff had to flag waiters down to get our bill. one of waiters is an eastern european woman who spoke no english and had never waited tables before. one of the waiters brought our chaat to our table and did not  even bring plates with our chaat. the food itself was good but not noteworthy. cafe krishna's chutney were not tasty or flavorful. the coconut chutney at woodlands  ray and rural is a lot better. our dosa had very little sabji  potato  filling and was nearly entirely just one large crepe. the dosa at woodlands  ray and rural includes much more sabji. jeff did like the sabji and thought the sabji was better than woodlands  ray and rural because the sabji was slightly less greasy. the samosa chaat was not good. the samosa chaat had very little samosa maybe two small pieces of one samosa   and the rest of the samosa chaat included vegetables. the samosa chaat was not  bad but neither was the samosa chaat tasty. the only positive aspect to cafe krishna was cafe krishna is  ambience. despite cafe krishna's  cafe  name  cafe krishna is a sit - down restaurant. cafe krishna  nicer than many full fledged indian restaurants in the valley. cafe krishna was clean  spacious with many booths. and decorated well. you are seated  given a menu and a waiter takes your order. cafe krishna  not like woodlands in which you order at the register. cafe krishna has a full menu but cafe krishna is  vegetarian. cafe krishna  also a south indian place so jeff would not  recommend ordering saag paneer and north indian dishes because south indians do not  know how to cook north indian food. jeff will not come back because the service was too slow. even when jeff flagged our waiter for our bill  there was another couple who had sat for    minutes and had not even had another couple who had sat for    minutes and had not even had their drink orders taken's drink orders taken. honestly  why would jeff wait an hour to eat dosa when jeff can go up the street and eat at woodlands  ray and rural and get the same quality dosa in    minutes. jeff m pretty forgiving of slow service if the restaurant is super busy or if there is only one server but this was different. you could tell waiters had no previous experience waiting tables and had no sense of urgency. waiters did not  know how to refill drinks  check up on you  bring your bill to you on time. it seemed like waiters were related to the owner or were part owners and tried to be servers. if cafe krishna improved cafe krishna's speed and service  jeff would recommend cafe krishna. hopefully that will improve", "relationMentions":

several times  and akhil usually really enjoy the food and service ! however  during akhil's last visit  everything well  sucked ! the chutney were watery the mango lassi was pure ice and did not seem to have any yoghurt in the mango lassi the paneer pakora were luke warm  greasy as all hell  and seemed to have been microwaved... the paneer tikka  not tikka masala was dry  unflavorful and was served with charred paneer and uncooked onions... only saving grace was the malai koftas ! akhil m chalking akhil's last visit down to a night off  -  till now charkha exotic indian cuisine have

kristina, kristina live across the street from charkha and have tried all of the new joints that have opened up in the past few months on w.  th. this is the first one that will have me as a repeat customer  over and over again. last night  kristina went over on a whim for some dinner. kristina stuck with what kristina know :  chicken vindaloo extremely spicy     . plain naan bread    . for a generous portion  and kheer for dessert  which is basmati rice cooked in sweetened milk    . . let me tell you  chicken vindaloo is spicy. you will need naan for this. wow... the rice was cooked perfectly. there was plenty of chicken and potatoes in the dish. very filling. naan was perfect  amazing  and absolutely wonderful. they make their food to order so you will always have fresh food. dessert  which is basmati rice cooked in sweetened milk reminds me of and old fashioned dessert  or grits. dessert  which is basmati rice cooked in sweetened milk  quite addicting actually. kristina had take out. the containers are reusable  microwave and dishwasher safe  for those of us who like to recycle. so that is  a plus. kristina's order took    minutes. which is awesome for made to order food. the staff was very friendly. kristina met the head chef owner who came out when kristina was placing kristina's order. these people had smiles on these people's faces  and not fake ones. these people really seem to want to serve you this food and proudly these people will do so. went back today for lunch. again  had takeout. kristina will try the   . all you can eat lunch buffet and will report on that next time kristina go over. anyways  today kristina had the shahi paneer     . - cubes of homemade cheese cooked in a creamy tomato sauce with herbs and spices  garnished with nuts and raisins   - omg what a dish. you can have the shahi paneer really spicy or just medium spicy. kristina choose medium. once again  rice cooked perfectly. a creamy tomato sauce is amazing and the cheese cubes melt in your mouth. kristina also ordered pashwary naan  bread stuffed with nuts  raisins and coconut  -    . -  simply delicious and filling. this is a great little meal in itself. nutty  flavorful  and warm. this naan they make is the best kristina have ever had. when kristina called to place kristina's order today  the girl remembered kristina from last night and was genuinely happy kristina was coming back. once over there  the owner chef came out and told kristina the owner chef's name  kristina kristina sorry kristina forget  kristina want to say rishi or something  and thanked kristina for returning. you walk out of there very happy kristina visited. it  a clean place  with excellent food and friendly people. what is not to like it by far the best new place on w. th

door closed. and then you can not  see a thing because almost no light gets into the lone toilet stall. the toilet paper is on a weird stick that falls on the floor and lands in... whatever it is that ends up on mens  room floors next to a toilet. so do yourself a favor do not  use the toilet paper. all of which might be tolerable except the light is on a very short timer  with a sensor that does not  reach into the lone toilet stall. so you will be left in the dark. and no gesture or flailing above below the divider will trigger the light. so you have  got to try to get yourself out of the lone toilet stall completely blind. a job for houdini. houdini m not docking a star  because m. avoid all restaurant bathrooms anyway  and m. m really more interested in the incoming food  not the

a few of the shooters they had to recommend to customers. it was apparent amber did not  want to be there. later on  the bill came to     so amber's friends put down two twentys and the ten dollar bill. the waitress  a stubby caucasian lady came over and said  a few friends need change   and amber did not. amber did not want amber's friends to pay for amber but amber only had a     bill with amber. the waitress  a stubby caucasian lady saw that amber wanted to pay for amber's own meal so the waitress  a stubby caucasian lady came over to amber and quickly said  amber's meal was      if amber give amber two twentys  from the pile  and take amber's fifty then amber have paid for amber's meal . amber  being a bit buzzed and tired said  sure and then the waitress  a stubby caucasian

caucasian lady's time getting the change. amber's friends were  too prideful  to stay and wait for the change but amber m quite sure the waitress  a stubby caucasian lady had no intention of bringing

has everything. you can come here for breakfast. you can come here for brunch. you can come here for lunch. you can come here for dinner. you can come here for drinks  finger food  as part of a night on the town. the menu is huge. the menu has everything from pad thai  to chicken curry  to traditional sandwiches  to pasta  to burgers  to french toast  to poutine and quite literally everything in between. oh  and there is  a wide range of teas coffees juices  beverages  and cocktails. -  the taste ! everything izzy have  tried here  and izzy have  tried a lot  -  most of the above listed dishes and drinks in fact  has tasted great. full of flavour  everything in balance  mostly mouth - watering. why am izzy writing this review just before lunch mhmm....    -  value. the red room is as cheap as you would  get in toronto. izzy discovered the red room the first morning izzy arrived in toronto on izzy's visa  and ate there religiously for izzy's first few weeks while searching for a job and an apartment. izzy would have starved if it were not  for the red room ! even when izzy got a job and moved out to the east end izzy still continued to return  as the portion sizes are ginormous  and will keep you full all day. not only are the red room's base prices well below the city average  additional deals are offered on some parts of the menu e.g. :  soup and sandwich for  . or something add on coffee to breakfast for just  . etc etc. -  layout. the red room manages to be cosy  yet also inviting to large groups  with most tables offering long benches as seating. d cor is mostly asian  with a trendy  modern twist. there  an outdoor patio for those summer scorchers. if choice  taste  value and layout are all you value in a restaurant  then stop reading and consider the red room a five - star establishment. the bad : -  the service is overall  quite bad. slow and unfriendly. izzy had the experience of our waiter not believing izzy were tipping enough  so our waiter just took our money and kept the residual change without even asking if izzy wanted any money back. this was after our waiter began to know izzy's boyfriend and izzy as regulars so our waiter's actions made us feel as though izzy were stingy and not tipping enough  even though izzy were leaving moderate tips for the service encountered . the horrifying : -  izzy can cope  easily  with the poor service but izzy cannot accept poor hygiene standards. unfortunately  izzy read a recent report stating that the red room failed a hygiene and safety inspection  -  one minor infraction  four significant infractions. izzy can turn a blind eye to many things  but not to food safety and hygiene standards. for this reason alone  izzy will not return to the red room. what a shame.",

wilted old lettuce soup. the soup of the day was disgusting. jessica kept trying to eat the soup of the day  thinking to jessica  -  there is  something wrong with the soup of the day. my mother - in

wrong with the soup of the day  jessica tell my mother - in - law. oh  no there is  nothing wrong with the soup of the day  - the soup of the day is  actually asparagus soup and jessica just forgot to tell you. exact words. not paraphrasing. it was disgusting. jessica was brought the dreadful tasting tomato chickpea soup instead and just could not  bring jessica to finish the dreadful tasting tomato chickpea soup. and this is just the beginning because  -  wait -  there is  more. last week jessica went in again and decided to order the pad thai. big mistake. jessica have had the pad thai

me a bit of attitude but said jessica could order something else planning on charging jessica for this food jessica can not  eat  . of course jessica am  there is  nothing wrong with this food. jessica replies haughtily. jessica tried to explain that this food was beyond hot and that this food was nearly impossible to eat. it  not normally like this. well that is  not our fault  its jessica because jessica did not  read the menu. jessica was aghast and jessica even brought the menu over to point out the two chilli peppers. jessica was beyond being explained to and was at a point where jessica was arguing with me  not letting me speak and telling me that it was my fault. jessica kept telling me jessica had to pay for a meal that was inedible even by the poorest of standards so jessica ended up walking out. jessica had at one point even asked to speak to the owner or manager. jessica actually smiled at me  crossed jessica's arms and said the owner or manager were not  in that day. jessica said jessica was in charge and that is  just the way things are. jessica have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before in my life. yes  the prices are good and the servings are large  -  but the service is gawd awful to the point where they should be reported to the better business bureau. the atmosphere is tolerable on some days and  rank the next  -  the music being the most obvious culprit. with no standards as to what can and will be played you can be tortured with just about anything your nightmares can come up with  -  and mid lunch  jessica just do not

how roy would react to the gunpowder prawns  and the  modern  scallop entree. roy need not have worried  since the gunpowder prawns  and the  modern  scallop entree were among the most delicious of their general type that roy have had anywhere. roy also got a serving of garlic naan  which was terrific  though roy took most of garlic naan home with the amazing basmati rice that came also. copper

these little guys were tasty ! peg really loved the sweetness of the chutney and the contrast with the tamarind. it was a little confusing at first  because peg m used to eating tamarind in vietnamese dishes  and tamarind is  used a little differently but peg thought the flavors paired well overall. - seafood meljol  : peg thought the scallops in the dish were a little undercooked. the dish also got boring pretty quickly. copper modern indian cuisine gave peg like four or five scallops  which is generous of them but the flavors were not something that stood out to peg. but  overall  a good

to be very busy  for some reason the food does not taste fresh at all. for instance the malai kofta  which tends to be a very popular dish  tasted like the malai kofta  which tends to be a very popular dish was at least week old. and the palak paneer also seems to be made with canned spinach or something of that like. a do not like the samosa either  which do not have the right melody of spicy  there is just something off. oh and just skip the pakoras which have no substance at all  and the aloo tikis are not made properly either  the aloo tikis are way too dry. and also if you try the chana bhatura  chickpeas with fried bread   beware that the chana bhatura  chickpeas with fried bread are not very good  the chana bhatura  chickpeas with fried bread are over masala - d or something and they put a ton of greasy carrot pickle on top. the indian sweets are decent  but a m not a fan so there is no motivation for a to come here. definitely skip brar sweets restaurant as a

some tikka masala  my go to  and spit some tikka masala my go to out. it was like taking a shot of salt. everyone else did the same. some tikka masala my go to was inedible. at least   of the other dishes were just the same  the only flavor was salt. overpowering loads of salt. and on top of that they had the heater on the lunch buffet set really low or even off  if the food itself had been any cooler chris would not  have even tried the food itself  for sanitary reasons. one of the managers stopped by to ask  how the food itself was at one point  and chris was honest with one of the managers. one of the managers did offer to have a batch of  low sodium tikka misala made up  which came out piping hot. and while it certainly was not  the salt bomb that the stuff on the lunch buffet was it was completely bland. it seems a strange turn around from the  was not  salty enough  comment here from   months ago. and chris know the business is still new but you would  think the business would  have the recipes in tip top shape after   -   months.", "relationMentions": [{"em1Text": "tandoori house", "em2Text": "tikka masala", "label": "has_menu"}, {"em1Text": "chris", "em2Text":

james was let down by the chai tea there was not very much flavor in the chai at all. sadly the chai was more brown water than anything else. did not  get any other drinks so james can not  speak for them the rest may be good. the atmosphere of tandoori house is not  enjoyable currently  though this is mainly due to remodeling they are  doing james think. there  not really any decorations on the walls  so apart from the tables the rooms feel empty. but again  they are  currently remodeling so the atmosphere of the restaurant will likely improve over time. the waiter felt very awkward and almost confused. and james do not  think james would  put it to the waiter being new to waiting tables. the waiter had the motions down so to speak but the waiter did not  seem to know what was going on. james asked if james paid at the table now or on the way out  and the waiter did not  seem to know. after a long pause the waiter said it was paid at the table but the waiter sounded very unsure. and throughout our interactions with the waiter  there was never a spark of personality. so comparing tandoori house to maharaja  which tandoori house took the place of. is the food better maybe some of the food yeah. the food  the same if not better. the chai is worse  though the rest of the drinks may still be good. the atmosphere currently is a far cry from maharaja  which it took the place of. empty walls and lack of any decorations make tandoori house feel unenjoyable and less fun. tandoori house lacks the charm that maharaja  which it took the place of had. and james can only speak for the waiter  but comparing the waiter to the waiters of maharaja  which it took the place of  there is  no contest. the waiters of maharaja  which it took the place of had fun personalities and were nice and very attentive  even at the lunch buffet where the waiters of maharaja are  needed much less. the waiter james had seemed like the waiter would  rather be anywhere else. the three stars are because the atmosphere  and staff will likely improve over time. and the food is already good. tandoori house has the makings of a great restaurant that will stand on tandoori house's own and not need

more traditional setting for indian food  but since t. m down with indian food and always like to see vegetarian restaurants survive and thrive  t. gave namaste a shot. on the positive side  the food had familiar flavors and seemed to be of good quality. no complaints there. the gentleman who took t.'s order was friendly and helpful and the   - ring binder with photos of the food was a nice touch. t. typically order t.'s food thai indian  mexican  etc. at a medium spice rating. apparently  medium  here is quite a bit hotter than what t. m accustomed to. keep in mind that this is based on only one visit here  but t. will definitely be trying  mild  next time. one slightly disappointing aspect of t.'s visit came when t. explained that the dish was much spicier than anticipated. t. had eaten about one third of the dish before reaching a point where t. could not  go any farther. it became apparent that the tasty touch were not willing to remake the dish  -  -  something that is a pretty standard accommodation when there is  an issue such as this. t. offered a couple of other options  the first couple of which did not  help. finally some veggie rice was extended and some veggie rice

 one star. everything is made fresh  and the servers are very friendly. another star. restaurant devi have an outside seating as well  and arnav think the view from there of the streets are just

are very much on the dry side  and required a lots of sauce to rescue pakora  the hot - garlic sauce coating on the chicken pakora was odd  but saved the chicken pakora from being a total bust. veggie

tasted like a pad thai dessert. the proteins were plentiful and cooked well  and the pasta was not  soggy so the pasta was definitely edible  at least . chilli beef :  david chose the gravy option and chilli beef : was one of the sauciest dishes david have  eaten in a while. and  like the pad thai  chilli beef : is  fine but completely forgettable. the pervasive taste here was basil  oddly enough

to have a place to go to when you have not  made reservation at guru lukshmi but you are craving for an authentic dosa  really bad. located in brampton  surprise surprise  in a plaza not very noticeable. ashna luckily got one of the last tables available in annalakshmi. the servers were very friendly  which was the first thing ashna noticed. since ashna's brother is vegan ashna was happy to see that annalakshmi serve a combo consisting of medu vada and dhai idli  but a combo consisting of medu vada and dhai idli was pretty deceiving  or maybe ashna just read it wrong because what came was a medu vada and idli both soaked in yogurt  rather than a dhai idli and a separate medu vada. a dhai idli was not  very good because a dhai idli was literally a tiny idli drowned in a huge  gigantic  rather  bowl of watery and flavourless yogurt. for mains ashna got the mysore masala dosa and ashna's brother got the chilly garlic dosa. ashna liked that annalakshmi did not  serve the food within a minute  which is what guru lukshmi usually does. the mysore masala dosa  arrived in around   -    minutes. ashna asked for no oil on ashna's dosa  since no oil was an option however oil was clearly used. furthermore  ashna's dosa was pretty bland. ashna could not  taste any mysore paste and the mysore masala dosa lacked flavour. ashna did enjoy annalakshmi's sambar  though ! the chilly garlic dosa seemed to be fine  since ashna did not  hear any complaints. while ashna were eating a waiting queue had formed  which showed that annalakshmi is doing really well. one thing ashna did appreciate was that when another customer asked to sit at our table while waiting for another customer's own table my brother kindly gave another customer a seat somewhere on the side and explained that ashna should get our privacy when eating. overall  ashna think annalakshmi has potential and that ashna just ordered wrong. therefore  ashna will give annalakshmi another shot for sure.",

consisting of different variants of dosa to appease each pallet. ahad went for the madras dosa which was quite amazing it had robust flavours and tasted quite spicy ! as an accompaniment ahad had the onion and chilli bajjis which were slightly oily but still tasted good. you also have the option to customize how your dosa is made  less oil  more oil  extra crispy  etc. . that is something to note if you like your food a certain way. service is always great here the staff always greets you with a smile and are very courteous; something generally not found in smaller ethnic restaurants from

bad... soft and the right texture. paired with the many sauces and onions and the whole dish was wholesome and rich and very filling. ahmed's friend ordered the biryani which while not bad  still is not  the way real biryani should be  and ahmed come from a city known for a city known for its biryani's biryani  - but then ahmed still have not  found a single place in america that makes biryani

there is  little room for patrons to move around get toppings  and employees to bus the tables. it is also quite loud. choolah indian bbq play music that sounds like you are  shopping at an h m. as for food  -  it is not  bad. but also  it really lacks that punch of flavor that brian have  come to expect and appreciate from indian food. it really tastes like choolah indian bbq dialed back the spices and heat to appeal to the midwest palette  and brian m not very happy about that. choolah indian bbq do not  offer any spice level when you order  -  but do have some hot sauce in the condiments area. unfortunately  some hot sauce just are not  the right flavor profile  -  some hot sauce taste more on the tabasco pepper side of the sauce spectrum  and less on the delicious hot curry spice side. it  just not the same. mango lassi is delicious. samosa chaat is also quite good. brian wish choolah indian bbq did not  use so many disposable plates  cups  plasticware. another negative compared to my favorite indian restaurant chain in austin  -  tarka. all in all  brian think choolah indian bbq is a fine quick alternative to say  chipotle but if you really want quality and

where rich's frustration is mixed. part of the reason the line was moving so slow is that cashiers were guiding customers through the menu in such excruciating depth that orders were taking multiple minutes to put in. one cashier actually brought samples of each masala to a group of four so a group of four could taste before ordering. while rich appreciate the commitment to customer service and satisfaction this was frustrating to watch. rich would rather see samples be given in a separate location so customers can make informed decisions before standing in line. now for the actual food :  on rich's first visit rich got the perfect balance bowl with tikka and lamb. the perfect balance bowl with tikka and lamb was exceptional. lamb was perfectly cooked and the sauce was the perfect pairing. on rich's most recent visit rich ordered the choolah indian bbq salad with salmon. rich would not  normally order salmon at a fast casual restaurant  but the strength of rich's first visit encouraged something out of the ordinary. the choolah salad with salmon was quite good  though not as a good as the perfect balance bowl with tikka and lamb. note that this is probably due to the fact

then the options to add the sauces to spice all the options up. misti also tried the two kinds of lemonade available  mint ginger and mango. mango was very mango - y that is  a word right  ! and mint ginger was just a hint but was very refreshing. so the food :  good ! now  the atmosphere : everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. the space is very open and offered a variety of options for

interested in the uyghur culture and cuisine after having looked up several media sources on - line  eric was very keen to come out charcoal kebab house after hearing charcoal kebab house mentioned as a dinner with friends. given charcoal kebab house's location eric knew eric would have to set a side a good day to commute here if eric wanted to reward eric's quest with a taste of the intriguing looking cuisine that was significant of to distinct central asian nation. but eric's quest to go there was commenced sooner that eric had planned when yesterday a dining companion keenly wanted to take a look when eric mentioned charcoal kebab house to a dining companion. and so eric did just that. eric were both off to a funny start when eric unexpectedly discovered that charcoal kebab house caters to both mandarin speaking and non - mandarin speaking customers when eric were given menus with chinese scripts in menus with chinese scripts in them. eric both had an amusing moment when trying to figure out what each dish was while also pretending to be academic linguists in the making by trying to decipher the chinese description. pretend - time was cut short when eric decided to ask the waiter if english menus were available  eric had a brief moment of embarrassment while going to get the respective menus. most of the items are laid out across on a one page fold - out menu each accompanied with a picture depicting the described dish. there are a few noodle dishes that looked similar to one another with the beds of noodles making the distinguishing the difference a couple of soups and stews and the more familiar kebabs with the turkic style thicker naans. so eric decided on getting the lamb kebab combo which comes with naan and an iceberg lettuce salad and also a langman noodle plate. the kebabs came out first and having not had lamb in a while taste of the bite size pieces were dainty for eric and even more so when wrapped in a piece of the naan bread. eric hope that the owners start serving an uyghur style salad at some point  an uyghur style salad would make all the difference compared to the ice - berg salads that are served at other more distinct places. but eric definitely loved the noodles and what made it really good was the spiced - up gravy from the lamb curry that it was cooked in. eric kept alternating between the noodles and spoonfuls of the naan bread. the flavor in the spiced - up gravy from the lamb curry that it was cooked in reminded eric of similar flavors found in some of the curry based noodle dishes in eric's country so it was really enjoyable to be able to taste something familiar from the langman dish. and if naan bread was also available as a side order eric would have asked for one to soak up some of the spiced - up gravy from the lamb curry that it was cooked in yes delicious. alot of the reviewers have mentioned the dapanji so that what eric will  have to try next time and maybe some of the other noodle

take out food and catering orders. while masala kitchen have a couple of small tables where one may consume freshly made food masala kitchen is not a sit down restaurant in the typical sense. . what is also useful to know is while the cuisine is indian the cuisine has an east african influence and therefore there are some important differences to the usual norther indian restaurant food. so for example the samosas have a thinner crispy  triangular wrapping rather than the doughy  thick wrapping associated with northern india. masala kitchen also have fried muhogo  cassava that you do not find in typical indian cuisine. masala kitchen make biryani in two styles  the east african way with the rice and the masala gravy separate or the lahori style where biryani is cooked and presented in one vessel. al had the opportunity to sample various dishes during our two vists there to work out a catering menu for our event. the challenge was to accommodate the significant number of vegetarians among the majority carnivores. the management was very helpful in helping us come up with a good combination of items. al's biggest problem was in trying to pick a few dishes as so many delightful items are available. al would highly recommend the black kebabs -  fried meatballs essentially  with the right combination of spices. bet you cannot just eat and stop at one. for vegetarians masala kitchen have the spicy potato balls  batetavada . al had chicken pakoras that were a huge hit with our guests. the chicken biryani is a must. next visit al want to try masala kitchen's masala fish -  their masala fish looked so appetizing but al truly was way too stuffed to try one more thing. our order for     people was ready to be picked up at the appointed time. the portions were overly

kal took beef     kababs and   pakora. samosa were ok  not the best but still very tasty. beef     kababs were tasty but very dry. but pakora were amazing ! perfectly spiced and very crispy. for entrees kal went with butter chicken  chicken korma  daal makhaani and veg curry and here  where kal m conflicted. while everything tasted good  nothing tasted like what kal used to. kal like kal's butter chicken to have a noticeable tomatoy taste but butter chicken  chicken was more rogan josh sauce. korma  again korma tasted good did not  have much of a coconut taste. daal makhaani was quite good. veg curry were well spiced and good selection. kal's rating of     is not  completely fair in that the food   service were both good the food service just did not  have the tastes kal have  come

hand saffron fine indian takeout is  solid food served quickly  friendly staff  and reasonable prices for indian in the nw side of town. on the other if cori m craving indian saffron fine indian takeout does not  quite satisfy. from someone who loves indian food and had traveled to india and eaten the real deal -  saffron fine indian takeout is  not quite to my quality of authentic. for example   the naan is closer to greek pita than cori would  expect. not that cori have an issue with greek pita... but just not always what cori m hoping for. that being said  there is not  a lot of nw competition for indian so it is sometimes better than taking a bit of a drive to something a little more authentic or going to a higher price point place that takes a while. saffron fine indian takeout is a bit different that some restaurants in that saffron fine indian takeout make a handful of dishes that day and you choose from a handful of dishes  -  not the menu unless you order in advance for a lot of people or something. saffron fine indian takeout will always have butter chicken and a dahl but other than butter chicken and a dahl you will  have to call or just go check it out. saffron fine indian takeout will always have a few vegetarian dishes and then some with meat. saffron fine indian takeout often have ocra and saag which are far from my favourites  -  and that is  sometimes a bit disappointing to me. the good thing about saffron fine indian takeout is the food is made when you stop in  but does not taste like buffet style that is  been sitting  so it is  quick to stop in and pick up. the prices for nw are not bad. for a veggie combo you get veg dish rice  naan and a curry for   . add a buck for a meat combo. add a couple bucks for a second veg dish. a combo with   dish is more than enough for me most of the time. a combo with   dishes is usually   meals if cori buy more naan. overall that is  not a bad deal when facing the cost of other nw alternatives.

darren was craving popadoms and the sauces and mango chutney that usually come with popadoms so darren chose taj indian cuisine & banquet hall because of the online ordering since darren where getting it to go. darren ordered a bunch of stuff including   orders of popadoms at   . each and   chutneys  darren expected at least a couple of popadoms per order at the same price as a nan bread. darren went to collect it and when darren arrived the order was only just coming in so darren had to wait mins this was not  really an issue as it was a sunday night and the game was on for us to watch.

of carrots and a bit of cauliflower ! darren's chicken samosa had no potato or anything else in my chicken samosa other than what seemed like ground beef. the garlic nan breads seemed to have no sign of garlic. the rest of the food was extremely bland and the rice was not the basmati rice you usually associate with indian food. the usually crispy mounds of onion bhaji were a bunch of soggy onion

different kinds at a place.   . the flavor... everything corey tried was incredible. and although spice heat is key to indian cooking theirs is well balanced  and not so hot that you can not  taste anything. corey had vegetable jalfrezi chicken tikka masala  masala dosa and garlic naan. all of it was awesome ! get these things ! even the garlic naan  which corey sort of feel like is tough to make incredible  but garlic naan was incredible. garlic naan arrived at the table piping hot and aromatic and did not  have an offensive garlic flavor. the chicken tikka masala was some of the best corey have  had  topping some of the curry corey long for in london. the veggies were tender yet crisp and in a super tasty sauce. and masala dosa. ohhhh masala dosa masala dosa was good  not corey's favorite  but with so many options  corey can not  wait to get back and try another one... maybe more adventurous than masala dosa. huge props to the stellar staff that made sure corey had no

the owner heard the door open and came out to take our order. maddie was having a little tough time explaining all the dishes to maddie's boyfriend but then the owner gave maddie a menu that explained most dishes for someone not familiar with indian terms. just like someone else said in their reviews maddie was disappointed when maddie was not  greeted or did not even get a smile. maddie tried to ease whatever tension was in the air by discussing some of the food items on a menu that explained most dishes for someone not familiar with indian terms but it seemed like it was such a big task to get the owner to even talk to maddie. that being said  the food still gets bollywood bites   stars and since bollywood bites is  a take out place the lack of smiles does not  bother maddie that much.

puris into the end product  maddie when maddie got home. maddie see the reason why they did it  the reason why they did it is to keep the puris from going soggy with the sauces filled in the puris too long but maddie doubt someone who is not familiar with indian maharashtrian street food  one of the biggest things maddie miss about india would understand what to do with a bunch of puffed up puris and sauces or how to make the sev puri. maddie you need to tap one side of a puri to make a hole through which you put in just a bit of potatoes  mint chutney tamarind sauce  yogurt and then top a puri with the sev  noodles  and eat a puri in one go ! maddie hope this helps some confused soul out there in tasting this mouth - watering off - beat cuisine  update : make sure the yogurt and chutneys are fresh before you take food home. maddie once got a bad batch where the yogurt had gone sour and the chutney container was puffed up with mold growing on the surface. since it was too late

india's flame also has a buffet if you want to try a variety of dishes  which pati plan to do for lunch one day. portion sizes are quite good pati had leftovers to take home. india's flame is a decent local spot for an evening dinner. pati were there on a friday night while india's flame was not super busy  india's flame had a good flow of customers and people ordering takeout. india's flame  still new and pati do hope people continue to patronize india's flame and keep india's flame open. one thing to keep in mind is that india's flame's heat scale is    -    . that would be scottsdale    -      as a medium was actually quite mild and a   was less spicy than pati's husband expected. not a problem you can just tell your server you like spicy and your server will adjust the heat to your liking. pati do recommend india's flame -  pati want to try india's flame's tandoori chicken sometime  as well as other dishes.", "relationMentions": [{"em1Text": "india's flame", "em2Text": "bhajis",

beef a small restaurant is a highlight in an otherwise drabby - looking plaza. the interior looks great and the service is simply outstanding by any standards. on a weekend evening  there was a steady flow of people for takeout and dine in  which made the service even more impressive ! sam ordered two pakora dishes  chicken and veggie  and two meat dishes  chili fish and bombay chicken . pakora came first. sam will  be honest : chicken was good but not great. chicken missing some kick and sam think the crunch factor could be higher. however... pakora made up for it :  very tasty and one of the few dishes where sam would  opt for the non - meat item ! chili fish was good  with a very optimal amount of spice for someone who can handle moderate amounts. but the star of the show is bombay chicken. sam think bombay chicken is  the preeminent dish to figure out if you like subtle tastes. bombay chicken  different from federick  and hakka legend with some savoury flavours that just bring out a special something. worth trying. sam got to pretend to be a serious food connoisseur by trying to figure out all the spices and seasonings they used here ! the only downside of a small restaurant is a bit beyond their control. lots of places have downstairs basement washrooms... but this one was particularly ragged. clean  for sure  -  but a little old looking. empty your bladder

tried shalimar foods for the first time last night due to positive reviews on yelp. chuck were not  disappointed. chuck ordered chicken tikka masala and chicken tikka. chuck are those rare people who actually do not  like spicy food but love indian as long as indian is  cooked very mild. so chuck always order super  super mild. it had no heat at all so chuck nailed it on the first attempt  which almost never happens for chuck. the flavor was amazing. the sauce had an incredibly fresh taste brimming with intense flavors and fresh herbs  so much so chuck could not  get enough. the sauce not exactly the taste chuck remember from chuck's days in california but unlike other indian restaurants that fall short at imitating the taste shalimar foods was just so amazingly unique in taste that chuck would  put shalimar foods on par with the best chuck have  had  just uniquely different. since chuck's favorite indian place in az closed  india  grill chuck have  been disappointed over and over trying to find another place. shalimar foods will be chuck's new favorite. just be aware shalimar foods is  really only good for takeout. as others noted  shalimar foods is  so tiny and not really outfitted for dine in. also  shalimar foods is  really hard to find because shalimar foods is  so tiny. the storefront is only about    feet wide and shalimar foods is  tucked between a chinese restaurant and a nail salon. chuck drove by twice and did not  spot shalimar foods; the owner had to talk chuck to shalimar foods ! and as other  have noted  it is  truly the owner and one other person cooking everything from scratch so it takes longer  over    minutes from the time chuck ordered . but there is  something really quaint about the whole experience; it is  like you are  visiting the owner and one other person's home and the owner and one other person are  whipping up some home cooking back in the kitchen. oh  and as noted  prices are very good. generally about     less than

going to graduate school for philosophy or something. add to the mix the trippy ganesha cartoon being projected on the window  and you are  definitely half way to manhattan. it  a cool sensation  and perhaps one that can only be experienced at a later evening hour. the best part :  unlike manhattan it is  easy to park ! go vegas. as for the food  misti rarely go out for indian dinner because misti find it hard to go without the cornucopia offered by a lunch buffet  which they do not offer . last night  though  misti decided on indian for dinner and this was close. misti ended up spending      which seemed expensive  but misti got three entrees when misti would have been okay with two. the average entree is    . misti had baigan bartha  paneer makhani and daal makhaani. misti requested a medium spice  and a medium spice was on the lower edge of spicy. of the three dishes  paneer makhani was the absolute best  the perfect balance of tomato and cream and without a trace of grease. they definitely pride themselves on cooking fresh and healthy. misti would not order daal makhaani again. daal makhaani is usually misti's favorite indian dish but this is the second time misti have had daal makhaani here. both times misti have walked away thinking daal makhaani tasted like a not so great chili. however  baigan was solid. misti misti went with roti instead of naan  and misti really enjoyed roti. the menu has plenty for meat eaters vegetarians and vegans  and misti am pretty sure they can help gluten - free eaters as well. the combination of experience and food quality adds up to

got here. it was thanksgiving day  so not much open and very few people inside. first of all  swatee m confused about whether chatpatay is self service or not. someone greeted us at the door and seated us  gave us menus. to place an order  you have to walk up to the counter. chatpatay bring the dishes to you. you need to grab your own utensils. chatpatay expect you to place dirty dishes in a far corner yourself. just extremely confusing and annoying. swatee have nothing against self service  -  in fact self service is  awesome and efficient  but this weird process made no sense. anyways -  the food. swatee started wit the mango chat. the mango chat was made with old papris and was over over sauced. swatee would be okay with that  -  if th sauce tasted good. th sauce did not  -  way too much heeng and terrible flavor. lily wanted to paneer -  paneer tasted of nothing  had a weird red color and the texture of rubber. swatee actually were not able to get through more than   pieces collectively. swatee also had the garlic naan. swatee think you should be punished for screwing up something as simple as garlic naan and they totally did not -  too much garlic and uncooked sides  ugh. swatee had the gobhi parantha and again  -  how you screw up something so simple  swatee do not  understand. the gobhi parantha was uncooked in placed and swatee could taste the raw dough. the filling tasted of nothing and there was not   enough of the filling. the gobhi parantha was also slathered with way too much oil  butter rags loves chicken  -  he did not  like chatpatay's version of chicken tikka. everything tasted stale and disgusting. as much as swatee hate food waste  swatee ended up trashing about     of the food swatee ordered and left chatpatay hungry still. never coming
