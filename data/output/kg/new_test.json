{'sentText': "bombay buffet indian cuisine, pierre, pierre have  been going here quite a bit lately since pierre moved back to scarborough and pierre must say it does the trick when your hungry. pierre have to say pierre have  definitely had better indian food for some reason the taste does seen rather bland for authentic indian cuisine pierre think the chiefs play it safe with the level of spice. most dishes are delicious it just seems like something is missing for authentic indian cuisine to be considered real great indian cuisine. pierre do not know enough about how to cook indian food to say exactly what it is. pierre like the fact that the dishes are not salty  the only time pierre feel bad from the food is when pierre eat to much. the tandoori although good seems a little short on flavor  small pieces the butter chicken is quite disappointing the butter chicken is very rich and does not  taste  like butter chicken pierre remember from other restaurants  not to mention the butter chicken has bones in the butter chicken what a sin. there always seems to be more sauce than chicken. the pieces pierre thought were quite small. the beef dish is good  the curry goat and chicken not so much the meat on these dishes seems very tough pierre think bombay buffet use the cheapest meat for bombay buffet. pierre have not   tried the dishes on the menu yet bet pierre assume the dishes on the menu are allot better. the veggie dishes seem old like the veggie dishes have  been sitting the veggie dishes's for days overall bombay buffet does not seem to heat the food pierre have never seen the food really hot there not cold just lukewarm. the only hot item is when bombay buffet bring the naan bread from the oven. pierre really wish bombay buffet had more of those famous  indian deserts  instead of ice cream which pierre do not  think is sanitary to leave ice cream there and everybody dig in to ice cream and they need to cover ice cream separately as well not just the door. the service unfortunately is not that great either the owner is very friendly however the waiters seem disengaged like the waiters just want to go home no small talk no smile nothing. the worst thing for m about being served in a restaurant is when pierre have to ask for everything pierre do not  mind sometimes but pierre always have to ask for another drink  more water napkins remove bottles etc. every single time. bombay buffet does give the appearance of being clean especially the washrooms which is one of the reasons pierre go back. pierre must say pierre have seen attitude from some of the staff again not the owner. on one occasion a girl working there who pierre never seen  before or ever since actually spoke rather rudely to pierre in an unfriendly tone for putting a little sauce back on the buffet dish from pierre's plate omg call the police lol. last thing pierre want to address is the decor definitely needs an upgrade seating could be set up better to maximize space the carpet looks old and decrepit and the t.v looks nice but pierre have  never seen the t.v on. pierre do not  think they want to pay for cable and no clock whats up with that oh pierre get it do not  let people know what time it is so people wo not  leave to soon or have another beverage. the thing pierre hate about the buffet section is there is no light pierre think it should be the other way around lots of light to see bombay buffet and less light in the dinning room perhaps candles would make for a better dinning experience  flowers would create ambience sometimes the music is too loud for dinning. pierre think rather than everybody so close to each other in the dinning room they should use the other room as well especially on the weekends where seating is an issue. one more thing  through the week business is petty slow sometimes only pierre and a few people are there. so why play games with the few customers you have  one time a waiter who is no longer there charged pierre imported price for domestic beer pierre brought domestic beer to the owner  attention and the owner adjusted the bill the next time pierre went no apologies were given everybody know budweiser is domestic duh. another time pierre specifically asked for a canada dry ginger ale and a canada dry ginger ale is  the name a canada dry ginger ale is listed as on the menu the owner brings a canada dry ginger ale to pierre and life is good. the next one pierre ordered the owner brings no name ginger ale pierre was so angry pierre just left as soon as pierre finished the meal pierre did not  want to lose it. ant the no name of course tastes like crap tastes is  why no name ginger ale's cheap but the owner still charged pierre the   . . one time the said waiter who is no longer there when pierre asked the said waiter who is no longer there when pierre asked him to remove the bottles from the table to remove the bottles from the table the owner said pierre have a big table with lots of room. what the hell is the owner talking to pierre like that for. unbelievable this is not how you talk to customers who pay your bills. as you can imagine it was reflected in the tip. another time they tried to give pierre a bottle of beer that was opened for days flat as hell they corrected that when pierre  spoke up about a bottle of beer that was opened for days flat as hell. look pierre m not saying to avoid bombay buffet at all  pierre just know they could make it a whole lot better. pierre usually go alone and pierre have  noticed the more people the better the service. the  bigger the tip by all means check it out bombay buffet used to be    . they just raised it to    . but the bombay buffet items did not change at all  nothing new added go figure.", 'relationMentions':
