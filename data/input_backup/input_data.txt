We were asked to seat ourselves as the place was pretty much empty.
I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and my friend ordered a vegetable curry.
Both dishes were pretty good but the whole situation with ordering, etc was just awkward.


Deep-flavored curry made with spices instead of using Japanese solid curry, domestic raw pork cutlet prepared every morning, salmon dishes prepared with salmon, and udon made with soup. We present dishes that are easy to see, but are not made easily. Come and play at Chanyeong Restaurant. (Weekdays: 11:30 am to 09:00 pm / Saturday: 11:30 am to 08:00 pm / Sunday: Closed / All menu items can be packed and delivered.)
